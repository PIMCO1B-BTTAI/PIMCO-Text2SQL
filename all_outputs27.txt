Schema Links for Question: List all funds with their submission dates
{'table_columns': ['submission', 'submission.filing_date', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "List all funds with their submission dates," we need to retrieve data from two tables: "submission" for the filing dates and "fund_reported_info" for the fund details. The relationship between these tables is established through the foreign key "SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER."

Since we need to combine data from these two tables, a JOIN operation is required. However, the query does not require any nested queries, as we are simply retrieving and combining data from the two tables based on their relationship.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT series_name, filing_date
FROM submission
JOIN fund_reported_info ON submission.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number;
```

This query will list all funds with their submission dates by joining the `SUBMISSION` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
