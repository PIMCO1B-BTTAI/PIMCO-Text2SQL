Schema Links for Question: List all funds with their submission dates
{'table_columns': ['submission', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'submission.filing_date'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The query "List all funds with their submission dates" involves retrieving data from two tables: "submission" for submission dates and "fund_reported_info" for fund details. The relationship between these tables is established through the foreign key "SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER". This requires a JOIN operation to combine data from both tables based on the accession number.

Since the query requires a JOIN but does not involve any nested queries (such as using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

process_thesql: To list all funds with their submission dates, we need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `SUBMISSION` table. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the funds, and the `SUBMISSION` table contains the submission dates. We can use the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the key to join these tables because it is a common field in both tables and is used as a foreign key.

Here's the step-by-step process to construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify the Tables and Columns Needed**:
   - From the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, we need the `SERIES_NAME` to identify the funds.
   - From the `SUBMISSION` table, we need the `FILING_DATE` to get the submission dates.

2. **Determine the Join Condition**:
   - Use the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` tables.

3. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - Select the `SERIES_NAME` from `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FILING_DATE` from `SUBMISSION`.
   - Join the tables on `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.SERIES_NAME,
    S.FILING_DATE
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
JOIN 
    SUBMISSION S ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = S.ACCESSION_NUMBER;
```

This query will list all funds along with their submission dates by joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
