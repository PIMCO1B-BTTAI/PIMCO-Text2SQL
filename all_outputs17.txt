classification reasoning: The question "Show me funds with the highest ratio of cash to total assets" involves calculating a ratio using columns from the same table, specifically `fund_reported_info.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` and `fund_reported_info.total_assets`. The task is to find the funds with the highest ratio, which involves sorting the results based on this calculated ratio.

- The query will only involve the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, as both the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` and `total_assets` columns are from this table.
- There is no need for a JOIN since all required data is in a single table.
- There is no need for a nested query, as the task can be accomplished with a simple SELECT statement that includes a calculation and an ORDER BY clause.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for calculating the ratio of cash to total assets. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains both 'total_assets' and 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d', which are essential for this calculation.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to calculate the ratio of cash to total assets for each fund. This can be done by dividing 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' by 'total_assets'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should then order the results by this calculated ratio in descending order to find the funds with the highest ratio.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the question asks for the highest ratio, we should limit the results to the top entries. However, the exact number of top entries is not specified, so we will assume the user wants to see the top few results.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="No complex joins or additional tables are needed for this query, as all necessary data is contained within the 'fund_reported_info' table.", helpful=True)]
