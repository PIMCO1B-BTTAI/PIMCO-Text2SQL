classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find out which investment firms manage the most diverse portfolio of fund types," we need to consider the diversity of fund types managed by each investment firm. This involves analyzing the data across multiple tables to determine the variety of fund types associated with each firm.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - We need information about the investment firms and the types of funds they manage. This information is likely spread across multiple tables, such as `REGISTRANT` for firm details and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for fund types.

2. **Determine Relationships**:
   - We need to join tables based on common keys to link investment firms with the funds they manage. This typically involves using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key to connect `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

3. **Calculate Diversity**:
   - To determine the diversity of fund types, we need to count the distinct `SERIES_NAME` or `SERIES_ID` for each firm. This requires grouping the data by firm and counting the unique fund types.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The query requires joining multiple tables and aggregating data to count distinct fund types for each firm. This involves using JOIN operations and possibly subqueries to achieve the desired result.

Given these steps, the query involves JOIN operations to connect data from different tables and aggregation to count distinct fund types. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires JOINs but not necessarily nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The schema information suggests that the 'borrow_aggregate' table contains an 'investment_cat' column, which likely represents different fund types.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed.
