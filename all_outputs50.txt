classification reasoning: To find funds with strong and consistent returns over all three months, we need to analyze the monthly total returns for each fund. This involves checking the values in the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, specifically the columns `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`. 

1. **Identify the Table**: The relevant table for this query is `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN`, which contains the monthly total return data for funds.

2. **Determine the Criteria**: We need to define what constitutes "strong and consistent returns." This could involve setting a threshold for what is considered a strong return and ensuring that the returns for all three months meet or exceed this threshold.

3. **Query Structure**: The query will involve selecting funds where the returns for all three months are above the defined threshold. This can be done using a simple `SELECT` statement with `WHERE` conditions to filter the results based on the return values.

4. **No Joins or Nested Queries Needed**: Since all the necessary data is contained within the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, there is no need for joins or nested queries.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection and filtering operation on a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.

process_thesql: To find funds with strong and consistent returns over all three months, we need to focus on the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, specifically the columns `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`. We will assume "strong and consistent returns" means that the returns are positive and above a certain threshold for all three months. Let's assume a threshold of 5% for this example.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.series_name
FROM fund_reported_info f
JOIN monthly_total_return mtr ON f.accession_number = mtr.accession_number
WHERE mtr.monthly_total_return1 > 5
  AND mtr.monthly_total_return2 > 5
  AND mtr.monthly_total_return3 > 5;
```

This query selects funds (`series_name`) from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table that have monthly total returns greater than 5% for each of the three months in the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table. Adjust the threshold as needed based on the definition of "strong and consistent returns."

  AND mtr.monthly_total_return2 > 5
  AND mtr.monthly_total_return3 > 5
