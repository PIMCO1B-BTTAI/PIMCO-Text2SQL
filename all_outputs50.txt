classification reasoning: The query "I need to find funds with strong and consistent returns over all three months" involves analyzing data from the "monthly_total_return" table to assess the returns over three months. The relevant schema links indicate that the "monthly_total_return" table is connected to the "fund_reported_info" table through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" foreign key. However, the query does not require data from multiple tables to be joined, nor does it require nested queries to filter or aggregate data across different tables.

Since the query primarily involves a single table ("monthly_total_return") and does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY." The focus is on evaluating the returns within the same table, which simplifies the query structure.

process_thesql: To find funds with strong and consistent returns over all three months, we can look for funds where the monthly total returns are above a certain threshold for each of the three months. Here's a query that selects funds with positive returns for all three months:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.SERIES_NAME,
    M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1,
    M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2,
    M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN M 
        ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = M.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE 
    CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) > 0
    AND CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) > 0
    AND CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT) > 0;
```

This query joins the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the foreign key. It then filters for funds where the monthly total returns for all three months are positive, indicating strong and consistent returns. Adjust the threshold as needed to define "strong" returns.
