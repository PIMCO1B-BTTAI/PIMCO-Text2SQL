classification reasoning: To determine which investment firms manage the most diverse portfolio of fund types, we need to analyze the data across multiple tables. Specifically, we would need to:

1. Identify the investment firms, which are likely represented by the "registrant" table.
2. Determine the diversity of fund types managed by each firm, which would involve examining the "fund_reported_info" table to see the different series or fund types associated with each firm.

This task requires joining the "registrant" table with the "fund_reported_info" table to link registrants with their respective fund types. We would then need to count the distinct fund types for each registrant to assess diversity.

Since this involves joining tables and aggregating data to count distinct fund types, it requires a non-nested query with JOIN operations. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
