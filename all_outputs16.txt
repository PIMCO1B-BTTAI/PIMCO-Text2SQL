================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all registrants from Florida" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically filtering by the state of Florida. This can be achieved by using a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter by the state. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

SELECT registrant_name

WHERE STATE = 'Florida';
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Query**: The task is to retrieve all registrants from Florida. This requires filtering the registrants based on their state.

2. **Schema Analysis**: 
   - The `REGISTRANT` table contains information about registrants, including their names and addresses.
   - The relevant columns for this query are `registrant_name` and `STATE`.

3. **Query Plan**:
   - **SELECT Clause**: We need to select the `registrant_name` to display the names of the registrants.
   - **FROM Clause**: The data is located in the `REGISTRANT` table.
   - **WHERE Clause**: We filter the results to only include those registrants whose `STATE` is 'Florida'.

4. **No Nested Queries or Joins**: The task specifies that no nested queries or joins are needed, which aligns with the simplicity of the query since all required data is in a single table.

This query directly retrieves the names of all registrants located in Florida from the `REGISTRANT` table.
