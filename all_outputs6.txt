classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the highest total liabilities, we need to query the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, as it contains the "TOTAL_LIABILITIES" column. The task is to identify the funds with the highest values in this column.

1. **Tables Involved**: The query only requires data from the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, as it contains the necessary information about total liabilities.

2. **Joins**: There is no need to join with other tables because all the required information is available in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table.

3. **Nested Queries**: The query does not require nested queries. We can simply sort the results by the "TOTAL_LIABILITIES" column in descending order to find the funds with the highest liabilities.

Since the query involves a single table and does not require joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."
