Schema Links for Question: List all registrants and their cities
{'table_columns': ['registrant.city', 'registrant.registrant_name'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all registrants and their cities" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically the columns "registrant_name" and "city." Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY." 

Label: "EASY"

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="The question asks for a list of registrants and their cities, which suggests we need to select data from the 'registrant' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The schema information indicates that the 'registrant' table contains the columns 'registrant.city' and 'registrant.registrant_name', which are exactly the columns we need to retrieve.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='There is no indication of needing to filter or aggregate data, so a simple SELECT statement without WHERE or GROUP BY clauses is sufficient.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the task is straightforward and involves only one table, there is no need for joins, subqueries, or Common Table Expressions (CTEs).', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The primary key and foreign key information provided is not relevant to this query as we are not joining tables or filtering based on these keys.', helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT registrant.registrant_name, registrant.city FROM registrant;
