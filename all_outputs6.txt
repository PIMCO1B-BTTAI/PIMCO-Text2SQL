classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have the highest total liabilities?" involves identifying funds based on their total liabilities. The relevant data is in the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically the "total_liabilities" column. 

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table needed is "fund_reported_info" since it contains the "total_liabilities" data.

2. **Joins**: There is no explicit need to join with other tables to answer this question, as all necessary information is contained within the "fund_reported_info" table.

3. **Nested Queries**: The question does not require nested queries. We are simply looking for the maximum value in a single column, which can be achieved using an aggregate function like `MAX()` or by ordering the results and selecting the top entry.

Given these points, the query does not require joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
