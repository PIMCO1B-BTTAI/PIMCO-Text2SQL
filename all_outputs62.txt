{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The query "Identify funds with high portfolio turnover based on their trading activity" involves analyzing trading activity, which is likely related to the "securities_lending" table. To identify funds, we would also need information from the "fund_reported_holding" table, as indicated by the foreign key relationship: `SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID`.

Since the query requires data from multiple tables, a JOIN operation is necessary to combine information from "securities_lending" and "fund_reported_holding". However, the query does not specify any conditions that would require a nested query structure, such as using subqueries with INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Therefore, the SQL query for this question would involve a JOIN but not a nested query. Thus, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

process_thesql: To identify funds with high portfolio turnover based on their trading activity, we need to focus on the trading activity data available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Specifically, we will look at the sales flow data for each month (`SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, `SALES_FLOW_MON3`) and compare it to the total assets of the fund to calculate the turnover rate.

Here is the step-by-step approach to construct the SQL query:

1. **Select Relevant Columns**: We need the series name, sales flow for each month, and total assets from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Calculate Total Sales**: Sum the sales flow for the three months to get the total sales for the quarter.

3. **Calculate Turnover Rate**: Divide the total sales by the total assets to get the turnover rate, expressed as a percentage.

4. **Filter and Order**: We will filter out funds with zero assets to avoid division by zero and order the results by the turnover rate in descending order to identify funds with the highest turnover.

5. **Limit the Results**: Optionally, limit the results to a certain number of top funds with the highest turnover rates.

Here is the SQL query based on the above steps:

```sql
WITH TradingActivity AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        SUM(CAST(F.SALES_FLOW_MON1 AS FLOAT) + 
            CAST(F.SALES_FLOW_MON2 AS FLOAT) + 
            CAST(F.SALES_FLOW_MON3 AS FLOAT)) as Total_Sales,
        CAST(F.TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT) as Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    WHERE 
        F.SALES_FLOW_MON1 IS NOT NULL 
        AND F.SALES_FLOW_MON2 IS NOT NULL 
        AND F.SALES_FLOW_MON3 IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        F.TOTAL_ASSETS
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    (Total_Sales / NULLIF(Assets, 0)) * 100 as Turnover_Rate
FROM 
    TradingActivity
WHERE 
    Assets > 0
ORDER BY 
    Turnover_Rate DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

This query calculates the turnover rate for each fund by summing the sales flows for the three months and dividing by the total assets. It then orders the funds by turnover rate in descending order, showing the top funds with the highest portfolio turnover.
