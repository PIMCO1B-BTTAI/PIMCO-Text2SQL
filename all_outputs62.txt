Schema Links for Question: Identify funds with high portfolio turnover based on their trading activity?
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To identify funds with high portfolio turnover based on their trading activity, we need to analyze trading-related data. This involves examining the sales, reinvestment, and redemption flows over the reporting period, which are found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Additionally, we might need to consider the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to link holdings to specific funds.

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: Contains data on sales, reinvestment, and redemption flows.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: May be used to link holdings to funds.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to associate trading activity with specific funds.

3. **Nested Queries**: 
   - We might need nested queries to calculate turnover ratios or to filter funds based on specific turnover thresholds.

Given the need to join multiple tables and potentially use nested queries to calculate and filter based on turnover, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT fund_reported_holding.accession_number, fund_reported_holding.holding_id
FROM securities_lending
JOIN fund_reported_holding
ON securities_lending.holding_id = fund_reported_holding.holding_id
WHERE securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund = 'Y';
```

This query identifies funds that are actively involved in securities lending, which can be an indicator of high portfolio turnover. However, for a more comprehensive analysis, additional data on trading volumes and changes in holdings over time would be needed.

SELECT fund_reported_holding.accession_number, fund_reported_holding.holding_id
