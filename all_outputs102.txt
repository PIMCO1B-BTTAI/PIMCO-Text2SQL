classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show funds with liabilities smaller than the smallest liability of any bond fund," we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the relevant tables and columns**: 
   - We need to use the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to access the `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` column.
   - We need to identify bond funds, which might require checking the `ASSET_CAT` or similar column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to determine if a fund is a bond fund.

2. **Determine the smallest liability of any bond fund**:
   - This requires a subquery to find the minimum `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` for funds categorized as bond funds.

3. **Compare liabilities**:
   - We need to compare the `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` of all funds against the smallest liability found in the subquery.

4. **Join or filter conditions**:
   - We need to ensure that the funds being compared are correctly identified, which might involve joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables based on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

Given these steps, the query involves:
- A subquery to find the smallest liability of bond funds.
- A comparison of each fund's liabilities against this smallest value.

This requires a nested query because we need to use a subquery to determine the smallest liability of bond funds before comparing it to other funds' liabilities.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_liabilities' column, which is crucial for this query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to identify bond funds. The 'securities_lending' table has a column 'is_loan_by_fund' which might help in identifying bond funds if it indicates the type of fund.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to find the smallest liability among bond funds. This requires a subquery to calculate the minimum 'total_liabilities' for bond funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The main query should then select funds from 'fund_reported_info' where 'total_liabilities' is less than the result of the subquery.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="A nested query structure is appropriate here because we need to compare each fund's liabilities against a calculated value (the smallest liability of bond funds).", helpful=True)]
