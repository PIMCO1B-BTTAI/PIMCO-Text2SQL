classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "I need to find funds with strong and consistent returns over all three months," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves analyzing the returns over three months, which suggests the use of the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, as it contains columns like `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`.

2. **Conditions**: The query requires checking the consistency and strength of returns over three months. This implies a condition that evaluates the returns for each month, likely involving comparisons or thresholds to define what constitutes "strong and consistent."

3. **Joins and Nested Queries**: 
   - Since the query focuses on a single table (`MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN`) to evaluate the returns, it does not inherently require joining with other tables.
   - The query does not seem to require nested queries, as it involves straightforward conditions applied to the columns within the same table.

Given these points, the query does not require joins or nested queries. It involves applying conditions directly to the columns of a single table. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'monthly_total_return' table seems relevant as it likely contains return data for funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are looking for consistent returns over three months, we need to aggregate data by fund and check consistency.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the average return for each fund over the three months and then filter for funds with consistent returns.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to ensure that the returns are not only strong but also consistent, which might involve checking variance or standard deviation.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, determine if a GROUP BY clause is required. Since we are aggregating data by fund, a GROUP BY clause on the fund identifier is necessary.', helpful=True)]
