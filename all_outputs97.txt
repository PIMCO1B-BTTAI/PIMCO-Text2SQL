classification reasoning: To answer the question "What's PIMCO's current duration positioning across their major bond funds?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Registrant Information**: We need to find PIMCO's registrant details, which would be in the `REGISTRANT` table. This involves filtering by `REGISTRANT_NAME` to find PIMCO.

2. **Interest Rate Risk Data**: The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table contains information about duration positioning, as it includes columns like `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01`, etc. We need to join this table with the `REGISTRANT` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get PIMCO's specific data.

3. **Join Requirement**: Since we need to combine data from the `REGISTRANT` and `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` tables, a JOIN operation is necessary.

4. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like subqueries or set operations (INTERSECT, UNION, etc.). It is a straightforward join between two tables.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query would require a JOIN but not a nested query. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine PIMCO's current duration positioning across their major bond funds, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: First, we need to identify the funds managed by PIMCO. This can be done by filtering the `REGISTRANT` table for entries where the `REGISTRANT_NAME` contains "PIMCO".

2. **Join with Fund Information**: Once we have identified PIMCO's funds, we need to join this information with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get details about each fund, including the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Join with Interest Rate Risk Data**: Next, we need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the duration positioning data. This table contains various duration measures like `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01` and `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01`.

4. **Filter for Major Bond Funds**: We should filter the results to focus on major bond funds. This can be done by checking if the `SERIES_NAME` in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains keywords like "BOND" or "FIXED INCOME".

5. **Select Relevant Data**: Finally, we select the relevant columns to show PIMCO's duration positioning, such as the `SERIES_NAME`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01`, and `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01`.

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH PIMCOFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        R.ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        F.SERIES_NAME
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
        AND (F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%BOND%' OR F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%FIXED INCOME%')
),
DurationPositioning AS (
    SELECT 
        P.SERIES_NAME,
        IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01,
        IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01
    FROM 
        PIMCOFunds P
        JOIN INTEREST_RATE_RISK IR ON P.ACCESSION_NUMBER = IR.ACCESSION_NUMBER
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    CAST(INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01 AS FLOAT) AS Ten_Year_Duration,
    CAST(INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01 AS FLOAT) AS Thirty_Year_Duration
FROM 
    DurationPositioning
ORDER BY 
    SERIES_NAME;
```
