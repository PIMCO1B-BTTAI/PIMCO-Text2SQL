================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "What's PIMCO's current duration positioning across their major bond funds?" we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: We need to identify which funds are managed by PIMCO. This information can be found in the `REGISTRANT` table, where we can filter by `REGISTRANT_NAME` to find entries related to PIMCO.

2. **Link to Fund Information**: Once we have identified PIMCO's funds, we need to link this information to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get details about each fund, such as the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Interest Rate Risk Data**: To understand the duration positioning, we need to look at the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table, which contains information about interest rate changes and their impact on the portfolio. This table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table via the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

4. **Join Tables**: We will need to join the `REGISTRANT`, `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, and `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` tables to gather all necessary information. This involves using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key to connect these tables.

5. **Filter and Aggregate Data**: After joining the tables, we will filter the data to include only PIMCO's funds and then aggregate or analyze the interest rate risk data to determine the duration positioning.

Since this query involves joining multiple tables and filtering based on specific conditions, it requires a non-nested query with JOIN operations.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

JOIN 
    interest_rate_risk irr ON fri.accession_number = irr.accession_number
WHERE 
    r.registrant_name LIKE '%PIMCO%'
```

This query will provide the duration positioning for PIMCO's major bond funds by showing the sensitivity of their portfolios to changes in interest rates across different maturities.
