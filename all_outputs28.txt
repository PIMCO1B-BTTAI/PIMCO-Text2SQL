Schema Links for Question: List all borrowers with an aggregate value over 200 million.
{'table_columns': ['borrower.aggregate_value', 'borrower.aggregate_value', 'borrower.borrower_id'], 'primary_keys': ['BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'BORROWER.BORROWER_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all borrowers with an aggregate value over 200 million" needs these tables = [borrower], so we don't need JOIN. The query involves filtering borrowers based on the condition that their aggregate value exceeds 200 million. This can be achieved with a simple WHERE clause without requiring nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query, which is the 'borrower' table, as it contains the 'aggregate_value' and 'borrower_id' columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to determine if any joins or additional tables are necessary. Since the question only asks for borrowers based on their aggregate value, no joins are required.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to apply a filter in the WHERE clause to select only those borrowers whose 'aggregate_value' is greater than 200 million.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query does not require any aggregation or grouping, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause will suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, ensure that the SQL query is structured correctly to retrieve the 'borrower_id' and 'aggregate_value' for borrowers meeting the criteria.", helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT borrower.borrower_id, borrower.aggregate_value FROM borrower WHERE borrower.aggregate_value > 200000000;
================================================================================
final_output: SELECT borrower.borrower_id, borrower.aggregate_value 
FROM borrower 
WHERE borrower.aggregate_value > 200000000
