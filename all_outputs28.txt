Schema Links for Question: List all borrowers with an aggregate value over 200 million.
{'table_columns': ['borrower.aggregate_value', 'borrower.aggregate_value', 'borrower.borrower_id'], 'primary_keys': ['BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'BORROWER.BORROWER_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all borrowers with an aggregate value over 200 million" needs these tables = [borrower], so we don't need JOIN. Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""]. So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query, which is the 'borrower' table, as it contains the 'aggregate_value' and 'borrower_id' columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins or additional tables are necessary. Based on the schema information, the 'borrower' table is sufficient for this query since we only need to filter based on 'aggregate_value'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to apply a filter in the WHERE clause to select borrowers with an 'aggregate_value' greater than 200 million.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and does not require any aggregation or complex calculations, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause is sufficient.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, ensure that the query is structured correctly to return the 'borrower_id' of borrowers meeting the criteria.", helpful=True)]

SQL: SELECT borrower_id FROM borrower WHERE aggregate_value > 200000000;
