classification reasoning: The question "What's the liquidity profile of funds?" involves understanding the liquidity characteristics of funds, which can be derived from the "payoff_profile" in the "fund_reported_holding" table and the "is_loan_by_fund" in the "securities_lending" table. 

To answer this question, we need to join these two tables based on their foreign key relationship, specifically the "holding_id" which is common between them. This requires a JOIN operation to combine data from both tables to get a comprehensive view of the liquidity profile.

Since the query involves a JOIN but does not require any nested queries (like using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the liquidity profile of funds, we need to consider various aspects that contribute to liquidity. In this context, we can look at the payoff profiles of holdings and whether the securities are involved in lending activities. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: This table contains information about each holding, including its `PAYOFF_PROFILE`, which can give insights into the liquidity characteristics of the holding.
   - `SECURITIES_LENDING`: This table indicates whether a holding is involved in securities lending, which can affect liquidity.

2. **Join the Tables**:
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `SECURITIES_LENDING` to get a comprehensive view of each holding's liquidity profile.

3. **Aggregate and Analyze Data**:
   - We can aggregate the data to determine the number of holdings with different payoff profiles and the extent of securities lending activities.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - Use a `JOIN` to combine data from `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and `SECURITIES_LENDING`.
   - Use `GROUP BY` to categorize the data based on `PAYOFF_PROFILE` and `IS_LOAN_BY_FUND`.
   - Use `COUNT` to determine the number of holdings in each category.

Here's the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH LiquidityProfile AS (
    SELECT 
        FRH.PAYOFF_PROFILE,
        SL.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND,
        COUNT(DISTINCT FRH.HOLDING_ID) as Number_of_Holdings
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH
    LEFT JOIN 
        SECURITIES_LENDING SL ON FRH.HOLDING_ID = SL.HOLDING_ID
    GROUP BY 
        FRH.PAYOFF_PROFILE, SL.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND
)
SELECT 
    PAYOFF_PROFILE,
    IS_LOAN_BY_FUND,
    Number_of_Holdings
FROM 
    LiquidityProfile
ORDER BY 
    Number_of_Holdings DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **`WITH LiquidityProfile AS`**: This common table expression (CTE) calculates the number of holdings for each combination of `PAYOFF_PROFILE` and `IS_LOAN_BY_FUND`.
- **`LEFT JOIN`**: Ensures that we include all holdings, even those not involved in securities lending.
- **`GROUP BY`**: Aggregates the data by `PAYOFF_PROFILE` and `IS_LOAN_BY_FUND`.
- **`ORDER BY Number_of_Holdings DESC`**: Sorts the results to show the most common liquidity profiles first.

This query provides a snapshot of the liquidity profile of funds based on their holdings' payoff profiles and involvement in securities lending.
