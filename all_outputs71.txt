classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Show funds exposed to non-cash collateral," we need to consider the tables and columns involved:

1. **Relevant Columns**: The question involves checking if funds are exposed to non-cash collateral. The relevant column for this is `fund_reported_info.is_non_cash_collateral`.

2. **Relevant Tables**: The table involved is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains the `is_non_cash_collateral` column.

3. **Joins and Nested Queries**: 
   - Since the question only requires information from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, there is no need to join with other tables.
   - There is no requirement for nested queries as we are simply filtering based on a single column.

Given that the query only involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question involves funds and non-cash collateral, so we should focus on the 'fund_reported_info' table which has the 'is_non_cash_collateral' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are interested in funds, we should also consider the 'securities_lending' table which has the 'is_loan_by_fund' column. These tables are related through the 'holding_id'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to filter the results to only include records where 'is_non_cash_collateral' is true. This will ensure we are only showing funds exposed to non-cash collateral.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We will use a simple WHERE clause to filter 'is_non_cash_collateral' to true, as this directly answers the user's question.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should ensure that the query is straightforward and does not require any complex operations like GROUP BY or aggregations, as the question is simple and direct.', helpful=True)]
