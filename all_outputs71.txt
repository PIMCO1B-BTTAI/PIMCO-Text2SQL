classification reasoning: The query "How has average fund leverage changed quarter by quarter?" involves analyzing data over time, specifically by quarter. To determine the average fund leverage, we need to access data related to leverage, which might be found in tables like "interest_rate_risk" or "securities_lending." Additionally, we need to group or aggregate this data by quarter, which is a column in the "registrant" table.

To achieve this, we will likely need to join tables to combine leverage data with the quarter information. This requires a join between tables like "interest_rate_risk" or "securities_lending" and "registrant" or "fund_reported_info" to access the quarter information. Since the query involves joining tables but does not require nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine how average fund leverage has changed quarter by quarter, we need to focus on the borrowing activities of funds as reported in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Specifically, we are interested in the columns `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, which represent short-term and long-term borrowing, respectively. We will calculate the total borrowing for each fund and then compute the average borrowing for each quarter.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need the `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR`, `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, and `QUARTER` columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Calculate Total Borrowing**: For each fund, calculate the total borrowing by summing `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`.

3. **Group by Quarter**: Group the data by `QUARTER` to analyze changes over time.

4. **Compute Average Borrowing**: For each quarter, calculate the average total borrowing across all funds.

5. **Order by Quarter**: Finally, order the results by `QUARTER` to observe the trend over time.

Now, let's construct the SQL query based on this plan:

```sql
WITH LeverageMetrics AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        SERIES_NAME,
        CAST(BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR AS FLOAT) + 
        CAST(BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR AS FLOAT) as Total_Borrowing
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR IS NOT NULL 
        OR BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    AVG(Total_Borrowing) as Avg_Total_Borrowing,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_NAME) as Number_of_Funds_With_Borrowing
FROM 
    LeverageMetrics
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

This query calculates the average total borrowing for each quarter, providing insight into how fund leverage has changed over time.
