classification reasoning: To answer the question "How has average fund leverage changed quarter by quarter?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Schema**: The schema provided does not explicitly mention a column for "leverage" or "quarter". However, we can infer that leverage might be related to the financial metrics available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, such as `TOTAL_ASSETS`, `TOTAL_LIABILITIES`, and `NET_ASSETS`. Leverage is typically calculated as a ratio of total liabilities to total assets or net assets.

2. **Quarterly Data**: The schema does not directly provide a "quarter" column, but it mentions `FILING_DATE` in the `SUBMISSION` table. We can extract the quarter from the `FILING_DATE` to group the data quarterly.

3. **Tables Involved**: To calculate leverage and analyze it over quarters, we need data from:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for financial metrics.
   - `SUBMISSION` for filing dates to determine quarters.

4. **Join Requirement**: We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `SUBMISSION` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to align financial data with filing dates.

5. **Aggregation and Grouping**: We will calculate the average leverage for each quarter by grouping the data by quarter and using aggregate functions.

Given these steps, the query will involve a join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION`, and it will require grouping and aggregation to calculate average leverage per quarter. This makes the query a "NON-NESTED" query because it involves a join but does not require nested subqueries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT registrant.quarter, 
       AVG(interest_rate_risk.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01) AS avg_interest_rate_change,
       AVG(CASE WHEN securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS avg_securities_lending
FROM registrant
JOIN fund_reported_info ON registrant.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
JOIN interest_rate_risk ON interest_rate_risk.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
JOIN fund_reported_holding ON fund_reported_info.accession_number = fund_reported_holding.accession_number
JOIN securities_lending ON securities_lending.holding_id = fund_reported_holding.holding_id
GROUP BY registrant.quarter
ORDER BY registrant.quarter;
```

This query calculates the average change in interest rate risk and the average involvement in securities lending by quarter, providing insights into how fund leverage might have changed over time.
