Schema Links for Question: Which registrants have multiple phone numbers?
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'registrant.accession_number', 'registrant.phone'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Which registrants have multiple phone numbers?" requires us to identify registrants with more than one phone number. This involves checking the "registrant" table for duplicate entries based on the "phone" column for each "registrant_name" or "accession_number."

To achieve this, we need to group the data by "registrant_name" or "accession_number" and count the number of distinct phone numbers for each group. If the count is greater than one, it indicates multiple phone numbers.

This operation involves aggregation and filtering based on the count, but it does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
