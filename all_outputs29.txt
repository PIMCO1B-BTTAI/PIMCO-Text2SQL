classification reasoning: The question "Which registrants have multiple phone numbers?" involves identifying registrants with more than one phone number. This requires checking for duplicate phone numbers associated with the same registrant.

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves only the "REGISTRANT" table, as it contains the registrant's name and phone number.

2. **JOIN Requirement**: There is no need to join with other tables since all necessary information is within the "REGISTRANT" table.

3. **Nested Query Requirement**: To find registrants with multiple phone numbers, we need to group by the registrant's name or accession number and count the number of distinct phone numbers. If the count is greater than one, it indicates multiple phone numbers. This requires a nested query or a subquery to perform the counting and filtering.

Given these points, the query requires a nested query to count and filter registrants based on the number of phone numbers. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To find registrants with multiple phone numbers, we need to identify registrants that have more than one distinct phone number associated with their accession number. This can be achieved by grouping the data by `REGISTRANT_NAME` and counting the distinct phone numbers. If the count is greater than one, it indicates multiple phone numbers.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    REGISTRANT_NAME
FROM 
    REGISTRANT
GROUP BY 
    REGISTRANT_NAME
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT PHONE) > 1;
```

This query groups the registrants by their name and counts the distinct phone numbers for each registrant. The `HAVING` clause filters the results to only include those registrants with more than one distinct phone number.
