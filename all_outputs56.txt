classification reasoning: To determine which investment companies are most exposed to international markets, we need to analyze the data related to the geographic exposure of the holdings. This involves examining the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, specifically the "INVESTMENT_COUNTRY" column, to identify holdings in international markets. Additionally, we need to link this information to the "REGISTRANT" table to identify the investment companies.

The query will require joining the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table with the "REGISTRANT" table using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as a foreign key. We will then filter or aggregate the data based on the "INVESTMENT_COUNTRY" to determine the level of exposure to international markets.

Since this involves joining two tables and potentially aggregating data to assess exposure, the query is classified as "NON-NESTED." It requires a JOIN but does not necessarily need nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The schema information provided does not directly indicate a table that tracks exposure to international markets. However, the 'nonforeign_exchange_swap' table might be relevant as it could involve international transactions.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since the schema includes foreign keys linking 'nonforeign_exchange_swap' to 'fund_reported_holding', we might need to join these tables to get more context about the holdings and their exposure.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter or identify records that indicate international exposure. This might involve checking specific columns or values that denote international transactions.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Determine if a GROUP BY clause is required. If we need to aggregate data to find the most exposed companies, grouping by company or investment entity might be necessary.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider the SELECT clause. We need to ensure that the query returns the names or identifiers of the investment companies, possibly requiring a join with a table that contains company names.', helpful=True)]
