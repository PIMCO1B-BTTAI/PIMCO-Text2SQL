Schema Links for Question: What's the latest filing date for each fund?
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'submission.filing_date', 'submission.is_last_filing', 'submission.filing_date'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "What's the latest filing date for each fund?", we need to determine the most recent filing date for each unique fund. This involves:

1. Identifying the relevant table: The "SUBMISSION" table contains the "FILING_DATE" and "ACCESSION_NUMBER", which can be used to identify each unique submission.

2. Grouping and aggregation: We need to group the data by each unique fund (which can be identified by "ACCESSION_NUMBER") and then find the maximum "FILING_DATE" for each group. This requires the use of an aggregation function (MAX) and a GROUP BY clause.

3. No need for JOINs or nested queries: Since all the necessary information is contained within the "SUBMISSION" table, we do not need to join with other tables or use nested queries.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a simple aggregation without the need for JOINs or nested queries.
