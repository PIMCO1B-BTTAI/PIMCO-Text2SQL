classification reasoning: The question "What's the latest filing date for each fund?" requires us to determine the most recent filing date for each fund. This involves:

1. Identifying the relevant table: The "submission" table contains the "filing_date" and "accession_number" which can be used to identify each fund's submission.

2. Grouping by fund: We need to group the data by each fund to find the latest filing date for each one. This typically involves using a GROUP BY clause in SQL.

3. Aggregating data: To find the latest filing date, we would use an aggregation function like MAX on the "filing_date" column.

Since this query involves grouping and aggregation but does not require joining multiple tables or using nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the latest filing date for each fund, we need to focus on the `SUBMISSION` table, which contains the `FILING_DATE` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER`. The `ACCESSION_NUMBER` can be used to link to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to identify each fund by its `SERIES_NAME`. 

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need the `FILING_DATE` from the `SUBMISSION` table.
   - We need the `SERIES_NAME` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to identify each fund.

2. **Join Tables**: 
   - Use the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to join the `SUBMISSION` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

3. **Filter for Latest Filing Date**:
   - Use the `MAX` function to find the latest `FILING_DATE` for each `SERIES_NAME`.

4. **Group By**:
   - Group the results by `SERIES_NAME` to ensure we get the latest filing date for each fund.

5. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - Use the above logic to construct the SQL query.

Here is the SQL query based on the above steps:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.SERIES_NAME,
    MAX(S.FILING_DATE) AS Latest_Filing_Date
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
JOIN 
    SUBMISSION S ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = S.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY 
    F.SERIES_NAME
ORDER BY 
    F.SERIES_NAME;
```

This query will provide the latest filing date for each fund by using the `MAX` function on the `FILING_DATE` and grouping by `SERIES_NAME`.
