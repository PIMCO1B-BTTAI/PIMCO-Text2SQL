================================================================================
classification reasoning: To examine PIMCO's securities lending activity and revenue, we need to gather information from multiple tables. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify PIMCO's filings**: We need to find the ACCESSION_NUMBER for PIMCO. This requires querying the `REGISTRANT` table to filter by `REGISTRANT_NAME` for PIMCO.

2. **Securities Lending Activity**: This information is likely stored in the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table, which is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table via the `HOLDING_ID`. We need to join these tables to get the relevant securities lending data.

3. **Revenue from Securities Lending**: To find revenue, we might need to look at the `BORROWER` and `BORROW_AGGREGATE` tables, which provide details on the value of securities on loan and the collateral received.

4. **Join Operations**: We will need to perform JOIN operations between the `REGISTRANT`, `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, `SECURITIES_LENDING`, `BORROWER`, and `BORROW_AGGREGATE` tables to gather all necessary information.

Given the need to join multiple tables to gather comprehensive data on PIMCO's securities lending activity and revenue, this query requires JOIN operations but does not necessarily require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

JOIN BORROWER b ON r.accession_number = b.accession_number
JOIN BORROW_AGGREGATE ba ON r.accession_number = ba.accession_number
WHERE r.registrant_name = 'PIMCO';
```

This query will provide an overview of PIMCO's securities lending activities, including details about the collateral and borrowers involved.
