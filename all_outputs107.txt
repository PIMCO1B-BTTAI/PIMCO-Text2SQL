classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find funds whose liabilities are larger than the average liabilities of bond funds," we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to use the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to access the `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` column, which contains the liabilities of the funds.
   - We also need to identify which funds are bond funds. This might require additional information from the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table or another table that categorizes funds by type, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the schema provided.

2. **Calculate the Average Liabilities of Bond Funds**:
   - We need to calculate the average `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` for bond funds. This requires filtering the funds to only include bond funds and then calculating the average.

3. **Compare Each Fund's Liabilities to the Average**:
   - Once we have the average liabilities for bond funds, we need to compare each fund's liabilities to this average and select those funds whose liabilities are greater.

4. **Determine the Query Type**:
   - This query involves calculating an average and then using that result to filter another set of data. This requires a nested query: one subquery to calculate the average liabilities of bond funds and another query to compare each fund's liabilities to this average.

Given these steps, the SQL query will involve a nested query to first calculate the average liabilities of bond funds and then use this result to filter funds with larger liabilities. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_liabilities' column, which is crucial for this query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to calculate the average liabilities of bond funds. This requires filtering the data to only include bond funds, which might be identified by a specific value in a column, though the schema does not explicitly mention a bond fund identifier.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the average liabilities of bond funds. This will simplify the main query by separating the calculation logic.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The main query will then compare each fund's liabilities to the average calculated in the CTE. This requires a WHERE clause to filter funds with liabilities greater than the average.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the schema does not specify how to identify bond funds, we assume that this information is either implicit or requires additional context not provided. The query will focus on the structure needed to perform the comparison once bond funds are identified.', helpful=True)]
