classification reasoning: To examine PIMCO's securities lending activity and revenue, we need to gather information from multiple tables. Specifically, we need to:

1. Identify PIMCO's records in the `REGISTRANT` table using the `REGISTRANT_NAME`.
2. Use the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` from the `REGISTRANT` table to join with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get details about securities lending activity.
3. Additionally, we may need to look at the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table to get specific details about securities lending transactions.

Given these steps, the query will involve joining multiple tables based on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`. This requires a JOIN operation but does not necessarily require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To examine PIMCO's securities lending activity and revenue, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: First, we need to identify the funds managed by PIMCO. This can be done by filtering the `REGISTRANT` table for entries where the `REGISTRANT_NAME` contains "PIMCO".

2. **Link to Securities Lending Data**: Once we have identified PIMCO's funds, we need to link these funds to their securities lending activities. This involves joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the key.

3. **Calculate Securities Lending Revenue**: If there is a specific column that tracks revenue from securities lending, we would sum this column for PIMCO's funds. However, since the schema provided does not explicitly mention a revenue column in the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table, we will assume that the revenue is tracked in another related table or needs to be calculated based on other available data.

4. **Filter and Aggregate Data**: Finally, we will filter the data to include only PIMCO's funds and aggregate the relevant metrics to get an overview of their securities lending activity and revenue.

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH PIMCOFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        R.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
    WHERE 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
),
SecuritiesLendingActivity AS (
    SELECT 
        F.ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        SL.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
        JOIN SECURITIES_LENDING SL ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = SL.HOLDING_ID
    WHERE 
        F.ACCESSION_NUMBER IN (SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER FROM PIMCOFunds)
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT SL.ACCESSION_NUMBER) as Number_of_Lending_Funds,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN SL.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND = 'Y' THEN 1 END) as Active_Lending_Funds
FROM 
    SecuritiesLendingActivity SL;
```

### Explanation:
- **PIMCOFunds CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) selects all `ACCESSION_NUMBER`s from the `REGISTRANT` table where the `REGISTRANT_NAME` contains "PIMCO".
- **SecuritiesLendingActivity CTE**: This CTE joins the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table to filter for PIMCO's funds and their securities lending activities.
- **Final SELECT**: The final query counts the number of distinct funds involved in securities lending and the number of funds actively lending securities (where `IS_LOAN_BY_FUND` is 'Y').

This query provides an overview of PIMCO's involvement
