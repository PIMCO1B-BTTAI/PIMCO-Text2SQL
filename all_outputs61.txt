classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each investment company manage?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each investment company. This involves counting the number of funds (likely represented by series or similar entities) for each registrant or investment company.

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the tables involved: We need information about funds and their association with investment companies. The "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table contains information about funds, and the "REGISTRANT" table contains information about investment companies.

2. Determine the relationship: We need to join these tables based on a common key, which is likely the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" or another identifier that links funds to their respective investment companies.

3. Perform aggregation: We need to count the number of funds for each investment company, which requires grouping by the investment company identifier (e.g., CIK or REGISTRANT_NAME).

Since this requires joining two tables and performing an aggregation, it involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question asks about funds and investment companies, so we need to determine which table contains information about funds and their associated companies.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we need to count the number of funds managed by each investment company, we will likely need to group by the investment company and count the number of funds.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to identify the relevant columns for the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses. We need a column that identifies the investment company and a column that identifies the fund.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider if any WHERE clause is needed. In this case, we don't have any specific conditions to filter the data, so a WHERE clause is not necessary.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, structure the SQL query to include the necessary SELECT, FROM, and GROUP BY clauses to achieve the desired result.', helpful=True)]
