================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which funds are taking on the most interest rate risk, we need to analyze data from the "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" table, which contains information about interest rate risk metrics. We also need to identify the funds associated with these risks, which involves linking the "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" table to the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as a foreign key.

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" for interest rate risk metrics.
   - "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" to identify the funds.

2. **Join Requirement**: 
   - We need to join "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" with "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" to associate the risk metrics with specific funds.

3. **Query Type**:
   - Since we need to join two tables to get the required information, this query involves a JOIN operation.

4. **Nested Query Requirement**:
   - The query does not require nested queries (such as using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN) because we can directly join the tables and filter or sort the results based on interest rate risk metrics.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
       SUM(ABS(irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01) + 
           ABS(irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01) + 
           ABS(irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_5YR_DV01) + 
           ABS(irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01) + 
           ABS(irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01)) AS total_interest_rate_risk
FROM interest_rate_risk irr
JOIN fund_reported_info fri ON irr.ACCESSION_NUMBER = fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER
ORDER BY total_interest_rate_risk DESC;
```

This query calculates the total interest rate risk for each fund by summing the absolute values of the interest rate change metrics and orders the funds by their total risk exposure.
