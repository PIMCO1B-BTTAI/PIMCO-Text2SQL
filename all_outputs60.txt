classification reasoning: To determine which fund families are most active in securities lending, we need to analyze data from the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table to identify funds involved in lending activities. Additionally, we need to link this information to the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to identify the fund families or series names. This requires joining these two tables based on the "HOLDING_ID" foreign key relationship.

Since the query involves joining two tables to gather the necessary information, it falls under the "NON-NESTED" category. We don't need nested queries, but we do need a JOIN to connect the relevant data from both tables.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'securities_lending' table is crucial as it contains the 'is_loan_by_fund' column, which indicates activity in securities lending.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to identify 'fund families'. This information is likely linked to the 'fund_reported_info' table, which can be joined using the 'accession_number'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should filter the data to only include records where 'is_loan_by_fund' is true, as this indicates active participation in securities lending.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause is necessary to aggregate the data by fund family and count the number of loans to determine which are most active.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should order the results by the count of loans in descending order to identify the most active fund families.', helpful=True)]
