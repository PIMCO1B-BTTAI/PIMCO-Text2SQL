classification reasoning: To answer the question "List the registrants whose funds account for more than 5% of total reported assets," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - We need data from the `registrant` table to get the registrant names.
   - We need data from the `fund_reported_info` table to get the total assets of each fund.

2. **Calculations**:
   - We need to calculate the total reported assets across all funds.
   - We need to determine which registrants have funds that account for more than 5% of this total.

3. **Joins**:
   - We need to join the `registrant` and `fund_reported_info` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to associate each fund's assets with the corresponding registrant.

4. **Nested Queries**:
   - A nested query is required to first calculate the total reported assets and then use this value to filter registrants whose funds exceed 5% of this total.

Given these steps, the query involves both a join and a nested query to perform the necessary calculations and filtering. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table is necessary to get the registrant names, and the 'fund_reported_info' table is needed to access the total assets.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to calculate the total reported assets and compare each fund's assets to this total, which requires aggregation.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the total assets first, as this will simplify the main query by allowing us to reference this total directly.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The WHERE clause will filter registrants whose fund assets are more than 5% of the total assets. This requires a calculation within the WHERE clause using the total assets from the CTE.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider how to structure the SELECT clause to return only the registrant names that meet the criteria.', helpful=True)]
