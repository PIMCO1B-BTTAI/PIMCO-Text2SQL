classification reasoning: To determine the quarter-over-quarter change in international exposure, we need to analyze data over different quarters and compare the international exposure values. This task involves:

1. Identifying the relevant tables and columns that contain information about international exposure. This might involve looking at holdings, currency codes, or investment countries.

2. Calculating the exposure for each quarter, which may require aggregating data based on time periods.

3. Comparing the calculated values between quarters to determine the change.

Given the complexity of these steps, this task likely involves multiple tables and requires joining them to gather all necessary data. Additionally, calculating changes over time typically involves nested queries to handle the aggregation and comparison of data across different time periods.

Therefore, the SQL query for this task would require both JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables and nested queries to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons. Thus, the query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the quarter-over-quarter change in international exposure, we need to analyze the data related to interest rate risk and non-foreign exchange swaps. The schema links provided suggest that we should focus on the `interest_rate_risk` and `nonforeign_exchange_swap` tables, specifically looking at the interest rate changes and swap termination dates.

1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to identify the data that represents international exposure. In this context, international exposure could be inferred from interest rate changes in different currencies or swap transactions that involve foreign entities.

2. **Calculate Quarterly Changes**: We need to calculate the change in exposure from one quarter to the next. This involves comparing the data from the current quarter to the previous quarter.

3. **Join Tables**: Since the `interest_rate_risk` table is linked to the `fund_reported_info` table via `accession_number`, and the `nonforeign_exchange_swap` table is linked to the `fund_reported_holding` table via `holding_id`, we need to join these tables appropriately to gather all necessary data.

4. **Filter and Aggregate Data**: We need to filter the data to focus on the relevant quarters and aggregate the exposure data to calculate the change.

Given these steps, the SQL query to calculate the quarter-over-quarter change in international exposure might look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    ir.accession_number,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN QUARTER(nes.termination_date) = 2 THEN ir.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01 ELSE 0 END) -
     SUM(CASE WHEN QUARTER(nes.termination_date) = 1 THEN ir.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01 ELSE 0 END)) AS qoq_change
FROM 
    interest_rate_risk ir
JOIN 
    fund_reported_info fri ON ir.accession_number = fri.accession_number
JOIN 
    fund_reported_holding frh ON fri.accession_number = frh.accession_number
JOIN 
    nonforeign_exchange_swap nes ON frh.holding_id = nes.holding_id
WHERE 
    YEAR(nes.termination_date) = 2024
GROUP BY 
    ir.accession_number;
```

### Explanation:
- **Join Tables**: We join `interest_rate_risk` with `fund_reported_info` and `fund_reported_holding` to connect with `nonforeign_exchange_swap`.
- **Filter by Year**: We filter the data for the year 2024 to focus on the current year's quarters.
- **Calculate Quarterly Change**: We use conditional aggregation to calculate the sum of interest rate changes for each quarter and then compute the difference between the second and first quarters to get the quarter-over-quarter change.
- **Group By**: We group the results by `accession_number` to get the change for each unique filing.

This query provides the quarter-over-quarter change in international exposure based on interest rate changes and swap transactions.
