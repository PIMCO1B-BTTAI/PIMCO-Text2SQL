classification reasoning: The question "Show me our best performing strategies in rising rate environments" requires analyzing performance data in the context of interest rate changes. To address this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Interest Rate Data**: The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table contains information about interest rate changes, which is crucial for identifying rising rate environments.

2. **Performance Data**: To determine the best performing strategies, we need to look at performance metrics, which might be found in tables like `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` or `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

3. **Linking Data**: We need to join tables to link performance data with interest rate data. This involves using foreign keys such as `INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

Given these considerations, the query will require joining multiple tables to correlate interest rate changes with performance metrics. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries unless we need to perform additional filtering or aggregation that cannot be achieved with simple joins.

Therefore, the SQL query for this question would involve JOIN operations but not necessarily nested queries. Thus, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the query "Show me our best performing strategies in rising rate environments," we need to identify strategies that perform well when interest rates are increasing. This involves analyzing the interest rate risk data and linking it to fund performance metrics. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Rising Rate Environments**: We need to determine periods where interest rates are rising. This can be inferred from the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table, specifically looking at the changes in interest rates over different durations (e.g., 3-month, 1-year, etc.).

2. **Link to Fund Performance**: We need to connect the interest rate data to fund performance. This involves joining the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` tables to get performance metrics.

3. **Evaluate Performance**: Calculate performance metrics (e.g., average monthly returns) during rising rate periods to identify which strategies (funds) perform best.

4. **Filter and Rank**: Filter the results to show only the top-performing strategies during these periods.

Here's an intermediate representation and the corresponding SQL query:

### Intermediate Representation
- Identify periods of rising interest rates using `INTEREST_RATE_RISK`.
- Join with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` to get performance data.
- Calculate average returns during rising rate periods.
- Rank strategies based on performance.
