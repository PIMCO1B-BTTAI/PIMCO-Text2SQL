classification reasoning: To address the question "Find funds with high liquidation preference relative to their size - might affect wind-down scenarios," we need to consider the following:

1. **Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to look at the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically the `liquidation_preference` and `net_assets` columns. The liquidation preference relative to the size of the fund can be determined by comparing the liquidation preference to the net assets.

2. **Calculation**:
   - We need to calculate the ratio of `liquidation_preference` to `net_assets` to determine if the liquidation preference is high relative to the fund's size.

3. **Classification**:
   - This query involves a single table (`fund_reported_info`) and does not require any joins or nested queries. We are simply performing a calculation and filtering based on that calculation.

Given these considerations, the SQL query does not require any joins or nested queries. Therefore, it can be classified as "EASY."

WITH FundPreferences AS (
    SELECT 
        SERIES_NAME, 
        LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE, 
        NET_ASSETS,
        CAST(LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE AS FLOAT) / CAST(NET_ASSETS AS FLOAT) AS Preference_Ratio
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME, 
    LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE,

    Preference_Ratio
FROM 
    FundPreferences
WHERE 
    Preference_Ratio > 0.5;  -- Assuming a threshold where the liquidation preference is more than 50% of net assets
```

### Explanation:

- **CTE (FundPreferences)**: This calculates the `Preference_Ratio`, which is the ratio of `LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE` to `NET_ASSETS`. This ratio helps identify funds where the liquidation preference is significant relative to their size.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters funds where the `Preference_Ratio` is greater than 0.5, indicating that the liquidation preference is more than 50% of the net assets. This threshold can be adjusted based on specific criteria for what constitutes "high" liquidation preference.
- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the `SERIES_NAME`, `LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE`, `NET_ASSETS`, and the calculated `Preference_Ratio` for funds meeting the criteria.
