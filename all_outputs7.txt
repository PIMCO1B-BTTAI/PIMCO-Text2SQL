classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have zero liabilities?" requires us to identify funds with total liabilities equal to zero. This information can be found in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, specifically in the "total_liabilities" column. Since we only need data from this single table and there is no need for any JOIN or nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_liabilities' column, which is crucial for determining funds with zero liabilities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are only interested in funds with zero liabilities, a simple WHERE clause filtering 'total_liabilities' to zero will suffice.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to ensure that the condition 'total_liabilities = 0' is correctly applied to filter the results.", helpful=True)]

SQL: SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER FROM fund_reported_info WHERE total_liabilities = 0;
