classification reasoning: The query "Find funds with high liquidation preference relative to their size - might affect wind-down scenarios" involves analyzing the "fund_reported_info" table for liquidation preference and potentially comparing it to other metrics like total assets or net assets to determine the relative size. Additionally, the "securities_lending" table is mentioned, which might be used to filter or further analyze funds based on whether they are involved in securities lending.

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Access the "fund_reported_info" table to get the liquidation preference and possibly other financial metrics like total assets or net assets.
2. Optionally, join with the "securities_lending" table to filter or analyze based on the "is_loan_by_fund" attribute.

Since this involves joining tables to compare and analyze data across them, but does not necessarily require nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To find funds with high liquidation preference relative to their size, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains information about the funds, including their total assets and liquidation preference. The goal is to identify funds where the liquidation preference is a significant portion of their total assets, which could impact wind-down scenarios.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need the `LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE` and `TOTAL_ASSETS` columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Calculate the Ratio**: Compute the ratio of liquidation preference to total assets for each fund. This will help us determine how significant the liquidation preference is relative to the fund's size.

3. **Filter and Sort**: We want to find funds where this ratio is high, indicating a potentially significant impact in wind-down scenarios. We can sort the results by this ratio in descending order to highlight the most affected funds.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**: Use the above logic to create an SQL query that retrieves the necessary information.

Here's the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH LiquidationAnalysis AS (
    SELECT 
        SERIES_NAME,
        CAST(LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT), 0) * 100 as Liquidation_Ratio,
        TOTAL_ASSETS,
        LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE IS NOT NULL
        AND TOTAL_ASSETS IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    Liquidation_Ratio,
    TOTAL_ASSETS,
    LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE
FROM 
    LiquidationAnalysis
WHERE 
    Liquidation_Ratio > 10 -- Example threshold for high liquidation preference
ORDER BY 
    Liquidation_Ratio DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `LiquidationAnalysis` calculates the `Liquidation_Ratio` for each fund by dividing the `LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE` by `TOTAL_ASSETS` and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.
- **Filtering**: The query filters out funds where either `LIQUIDATION_PREFERENCE` or `TOTAL_ASSETS` is null to ensure valid calculations.
- **Threshold**: The `WHERE` clause in the final `SELECT` statement uses a threshold (e.g., `Liquidation_Ratio > 10`) to identify funds with a high liquidation preference relative to their size. This threshold can be adjusted based on specific criteria or analysis needs.
- **Sorting**: The results are sorted by `Liquidation_Ratio` in descending order to highlight funds with the highest relative liquidation preference.
