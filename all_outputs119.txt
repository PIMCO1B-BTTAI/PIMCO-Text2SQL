{'table_columns': ['interest_rate_risk.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}

classification reasoning: To determine how fund leverage has changed over time, we need to analyze data that reflects the fund's leverage metrics across different time periods. This typically involves examining changes in the fund's assets, liabilities, and possibly other financial metrics that indicate leverage.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about total assets, total liabilities, and net assets, which are crucial for calculating leverage.
   - The `SUBMISSION` table contains filing dates, which can help track changes over time.

2. **Determine Necessary Joins**:
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `SUBMISSION` to get the filing dates associated with each report, allowing us to track changes over time.

3. **Consider Time Series Analysis**:
   - We need to analyze how these metrics change over different filing dates, which requires sorting or grouping by filing date.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since this query involves joining multiple tables (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION`) to track changes over time, it requires a JOIN operation.
   - However, it does not necessarily require nested queries, as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, or subqueries.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires JOINs but not nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT s.filing_date, 
       AVG(ir.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01) AS avg_interest_rate_change, 
       COUNT(sl.is_loan_by_fund) AS loan_count
FROM submission s
JOIN fund_reported_info fri ON s.accession_number = fri.accession_number
JOIN interest_rate_risk ir ON fri.accession_number = ir.accession_number
JOIN fund_reported_holding frh ON fri.accession_number = frh.accession_number
JOIN securities_lending sl ON frh.holding_id = sl.holding_id
GROUP BY s.filing_date
ORDER BY s.filing_date;
```

This query will provide insights into how the fund's leverage, as indicated by interest rate sensitivity and securities lending activities, has changed over time.
