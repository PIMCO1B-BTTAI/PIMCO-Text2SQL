classification reasoning: To determine how fund leverage has changed over time, we need to analyze data from multiple tables. Specifically, we need to consider:

1. **Securities Lending**: The `is_loan_by_fund` column in the `securities_lending` table indicates whether a fund has loans, which is a component of leverage.

2. **Interest Rate Risk**: The `intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01` column in the `interest_rate_risk` table provides information on interest rate changes, which can affect leverage.

To analyze changes over time, we need to track these metrics across different periods, which implies using the `quarter` or `report_date` from the `submission` table to understand the temporal aspect.

Given that we need to combine data from multiple tables (`securities_lending`, `interest_rate_risk`, and potentially `submission` for time tracking), this requires JOIN operations. However, since the question does not specify a need for nested queries (like using subqueries with conditions that require filtering based on results from another query), it falls under the category of requiring JOINs but not nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To analyze how fund leverage has changed over time, we need to focus on the borrowing activities of funds, which are typically captured in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This table contains columns related to borrowing, such as `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, which represent short-term and long-term borrowing, respectively. We can calculate the total borrowing and compare it to the total assets to determine leverage.

Here's a step-by-step approach to constructing the SQL query:

1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR`, `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, and `TOTAL_ASSETS` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. We also need the `QUARTER` column to analyze changes over time.

2. **Calculate Total Borrowing**: Sum the short-term and long-term borrowing to get the total borrowing for each fund.

3. **Calculate Leverage Ratio**: Divide the total borrowing by the total assets to get the leverage ratio.

4. **Group by Quarter**: Aggregate the data by quarter to observe changes over time.

5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Use the above steps to create a SQL query that calculates the average leverage ratio for each quarter.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
WITH LeverageMetrics AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        CAST(BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR AS FLOAT) + 
        CAST(BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR AS FLOAT) as Total_Borrowing,
        CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT) as Total_Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR IS NOT NULL 
        OR BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    AVG(Total_Borrowing / NULLIF(Total_Assets, 0)) as Avg_Leverage_Ratio,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_NAME) as Number_of_Funds_With_Borrowing
FROM 
    LeverageMetrics
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

This query calculates the average leverage ratio for each quarter by dividing the total borrowing by the total assets for each fund, then averaging these ratios across all funds in each quarter. The `NULLIF` function is used to avoid division by zero. The results are ordered by quarter in descending order to show the most recent data first.
