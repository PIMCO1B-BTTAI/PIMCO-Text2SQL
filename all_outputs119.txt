classification reasoning: The query "List states with the highest average net assets per fund" involves calculating the average net assets per fund and then identifying the state with the highest average. This requires data from two tables: "registrant" for state information and "fund_reported_info" for net assets. To achieve this, we need to join these tables on the common "ACCESSION_NUMBER" field. After joining, we will group the data by state, calculate the average net assets for each state, and then find the state with the highest average. This process involves using JOIN and aggregation functions, but it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table contains the 'state' column, and the 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'net_assets' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to join 'registrant' and 'fund_reported_info' on their common 'accession_number' to associate states with their respective net assets.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to calculate the average net assets per fund for each state. This requires grouping by 'state' and using the AVG() function on 'net_assets'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='To find the states with the highest average net assets, we should order the results by the average in descending order.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider the structure of the SQL query. It will involve a SELECT statement with a JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses.', helpful=True)]
