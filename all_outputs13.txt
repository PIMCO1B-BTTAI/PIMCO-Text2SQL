classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most cash on hand, we need to look at the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column, which represents cash holdings or equivalents not categorized in specific asset parts. We need to identify the funds with the highest values in this column.

- The query involves only the `fund_reported_info` table.
- We do not need to join with any other tables.
- We do not need nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' column, which likely represents the cash on hand for each fund.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are interested in the funds with the most cash, we need to aggregate the cash values and possibly sort them to find the top funds.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider how to structure the SELECT clause. We need to select the fund identifier and the cash amount to determine which funds have the most cash.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause is not necessary here because we are not aggregating multiple rows per fund; instead, we are simply ordering by the cash amount.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider how to structure the ORDER BY clause. We should order the results by 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' in descending order to get the funds with the most cash at the top.", helpful=True)]
