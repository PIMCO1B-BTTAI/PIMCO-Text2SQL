================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "What's the average yield on our defaulted bonds? Need to see recovery potential," we need to analyze the schema links and the relationships between the tables involved.

1. **Identify the Tables and Columns Involved:**
   - The query involves checking for defaulted bonds, which relates to the `debt_security.is_default` column.
   - The query also mentions "average yield" and "recovery potential," which might relate to financial performance metrics, potentially involving the `monthly_total_return` table.

2. **Determine the Relationships:**
   - The `debt_security` table is linked to the `fund_reported_holding` table through the `HOLDING_ID`.
   - The `monthly_total_return` table is linked to the `fund_reported_info` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Assess the Need for Joins or Nested Queries:**
   - To calculate the average yield on defaulted bonds, we need to filter bonds that are marked as defaulted (`debt_security.is_default = TRUE`).
   - We may need to join the `debt_security` table with the `fund_reported_holding` table to access relevant financial data.
   - If recovery potential involves additional calculations or conditions, it might require further joins or nested queries.

4. **Classification:**
   - Since the query involves multiple tables and potentially requires joining `debt_security` with `fund_reported_holding

classification: "NESTED"

process_thesql: To find the average yield on defaulted bonds, we need to focus on the `DEBT_SECURITY` table to identify bonds that are marked as defaulted. We will then calculate the average of the `ANNUALIZED_RATE` for these defaulted bonds. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify Defaulted Bonds**: We need to filter the `DEBT_SECURITY` table to find bonds where `IS_DEFAULT` is 'Y'.
2. **Calculate Average Yield**: We will calculate the average of the `ANNUALIZED_RATE` for these defaulted bonds.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH DefaultedBonds AS (
    SELECT 
        DS.ANNUALIZED_RATE
    FROM 
        DEBT_SECURITY DS
    WHERE 
        DS.IS_DEFAULT = 'Y'
        AND DS.ANNUALIZED_RATE IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    AVG(CAST(ANNUALIZED_RATE AS FLOAT)) AS Average_Yield
FROM 
    DefaultedBonds;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: We use a CTE named `DefaultedBonds` to select the `ANNUALIZED_RATE` of bonds that are defaulted (`IS_DEFAULT = 'Y'`).
- **Average Calculation**: We then calculate the average of these annualized rates using the `AVG` function, casting the `ANNUALIZED_RATE` to a float to ensure numerical operations are performed correctly.

This query will provide the average yield on defaulted bonds, which can help in assessing the recovery potential.
