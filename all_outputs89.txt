Schema Links for Question: What's the average yield on our defaulted bonds? Need to see recovery potential.
{'table_columns': ['debt_security.is_default', 'monthly_total_return.monthly_total_return_id'], 'primary_keys': ['MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "What's the average yield on our defaulted bonds? Need to see recovery potential," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Defaulted Bonds**: We need to find bonds that are in default. This information is available in the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, specifically in the `IS_DEFAULT` column.

2. **Calculate Average Yield**: To calculate the average yield, we need to access the `ANNUALIZED_RATE` column in the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, which provides the interest rate of the debt securities.

3. **Recovery Potential**: The question mentions "recovery potential," which might imply looking at additional metrics or data to assess potential recovery. However, based on the schema provided, there is no direct column that indicates recovery potential. This might require additional context or data not present in the schema.

4. **Table Relationships**: The `DEBT_SECURITY` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table through the `HOLDING_ID` foreign key. However, for this specific query, we are primarily interested in the `DEBT_SECURITY` table.

Since the query involves only the `DEBT_SECURITY` table and does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To find the average yield on defaulted bonds and assess recovery potential, we need to join the `DEBT_SECURITY` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to filter for defaulted bonds, and then calculate the average yield using the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(mtr.monthly_total_return1 + mtr.monthly_total_return2 + mtr.monthly_total_return3) / 3 AS average_yield
FROM debt_security ds
JOIN fund_reported_holding frh ON ds.holding_id = frh.holding_id
JOIN monthly_total_return mtr ON frh.accession_number = mtr.accession_number
WHERE ds.is_default = 'Y';
```

This query calculates the average yield of defaulted bonds by averaging the monthly total returns over the three months for each defaulted bond.
================================================================================
final_output: 
SELECT AVG((mtr.monthly_total_return1 + mtr.monthly_total_return2 + mtr.monthly_total_return3) / 3.0) AS average_yield
FROM debt_security ds
JOIN fund_reported_holding frh ON ds.holding_id = frh.holding_id
JOIN monthly_total_return mtr ON frh.accession_number = mtr.accession_number
WHERE ds.is_default = 'Y'

Result: False
