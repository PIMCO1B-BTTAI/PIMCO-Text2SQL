classification reasoning: To answer the question "What are the top 5 largest funds by total assets for each quarter?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: We need data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get the `TOTAL_ASSETS` of each fund. Additionally, we need to determine the quarter for each filing, which might involve the `SUBMISSION` table if it contains date-related information that can be used to derive the quarter.

2. **Grouping and Ranking**: We need to group the data by quarter and then rank the funds within each quarter based on their `TOTAL_ASSETS`. This typically requires a window function like `ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()` to rank the funds and then filter to get the top 5 for each quarter.

3. **Join Requirement**: If the quarter information is not directly available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, we will need to join it with the `SUBMISSION` table to derive the quarter from the `FILING_DATE`.

4. **Nested Query**: To achieve the ranking and filtering for the top 5 funds per quarter, a nested query is often necessary. The inner query can rank the funds, and the outer query can filter the top 5 for each quarter.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve both a join and a nested query to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To find the top 5 largest funds by total assets for each quarter, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: We need to use the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get the `TOTAL_ASSETS` and the `SUBMISSION` table to determine the quarter based on the `FILING_DATE`.

2. **Determine the Quarter**: We can extract the quarter from the `FILING_DATE` in the `SUBMISSION` table. This can be done using SQL functions to extract the month and then determine the quarter.

3. **Join the Tables**: We need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` tables using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the foreign key.

4. **Group and Rank the Funds**: We will group the results by quarter and rank the funds by `TOTAL_ASSETS` within each quarter.

5. **Select the Top 5 Funds**: For each quarter, we will select the top 5 funds based on the `TOTAL_ASSETS`.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH QuarterlyFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        fri.TOTAL_ASSETS,
        EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.FILING_DATE) AS quarter,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.FILING_DATE) ORDER BY fri.TOTAL_ASSETS DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO fri
    JOIN 
        SUBMISSION s ON fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s.ACCESSION_NUMBER
)
SELECT 
    ACCESSION_NUMBER,
    TOTAL_ASSETS,
    quarter
FROM 
    QuarterlyFunds
WHERE 
    rank <= 5;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: We use a CTE named `QuarterlyFunds` to calculate the rank of each fund's total assets within each quarter.
- **EXTRACT Function**: This function is used to determine the quarter from the `FILING_DATE`.
- **ROW_NUMBER()**: This window function assigns a rank to each fund within its respective quarter based on `TOTAL_ASSETS`.
- **PARTITION BY**: This clause is used to reset the row number for each quarter.
- **Final Selection**: We select only those funds with a rank of 5 or less, which gives us the top 5 funds by total assets for each quarter.
