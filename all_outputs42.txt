Schema Links for Question: List all funds with their registrant names
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with their registrant names" involves data from two tables: "registrant" for registrant names and "fund_reported_info" for fund details. To list funds with their corresponding registrant names, we need to join these two tables based on a common key, which is the "ACCESSION_NUMBER." This requires a JOIN operation. Since the query involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED." 

Label: "NON-NESTED"

classification: "NON-NESTED"

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question asks for funds and their registrant names, so we need to consider tables that contain information about funds and registrants.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins are needed. Based on the schema information, there is a foreign key relationship between REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER and FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER. This suggests that we need to join these tables to get the required information.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to select the appropriate columns. The columns of interest are 'registrant_name' from the REGISTRANT table and any identifier for funds from the FUND_REPORTED_INFO table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider if any filtering or grouping is necessary. Since the question does not specify any conditions or aggregations, we do not need a WHERE clause or GROUP BY clause.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, structure the SQL query to include the necessary SELECT and JOIN clauses to retrieve the desired information.', helpful=True)]
