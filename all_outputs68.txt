classification reasoning: The question "How has the average fund size changed over the last few quarters?" involves analyzing the average fund size over time, which requires data from the "fund_reported_info" table for fund size details and the "registrant" table for quarter information. 

To calculate the average fund size over multiple quarters, we need to group the data by quarter and calculate the average for each group. This operation involves joining the "fund_reported_info" and "registrant" tables on the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" to get the necessary data for each quarter.

Since the query requires a JOIN to combine data from multiple tables but does not require nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine how the average fund size has changed over the last few quarters, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains information about each fund, including its total assets and the quarter in which the data was reported. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need the `TOTAL_ASSETS` and `QUARTER` columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. The `TOTAL_ASSETS` column will help us calculate the average fund size, and the `QUARTER` column will allow us to group the data by quarter.

2. **Filter and Group Data**: We will group the data by `QUARTER` to calculate the average fund size for each quarter. This involves using the `AVG` function on the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column.

3. **Order the Results**: Finally, we will order the results by `QUARTER` to see the trend over time.

Now, let's construct the SQL query based on these steps:

```sql
WITH QuarterlySizes AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_NAME) as Number_of_Funds,
        AVG(CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT)) as Average_Fund_Size,
        SUM(CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT)) as Total_Industry_Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        TOTAL_ASSETS IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        QUARTER
)
SELECT * FROM QuarterlySizes
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **WITH Clause (QuarterlySizes)**: This common table expression (CTE) calculates the number of funds, average fund size, and total industry assets for each quarter.
- **SELECT Statement**: We select all columns from the `QuarterlySizes` CTE to get the desired metrics.
- **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by `QUARTER` in descending order to show the most recent quarters first.

This query will provide a clear view of how the average fund size has evolved over the last few quarters.
