================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "How has the average fund size changed over the last few quarters?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The question is about the average fund size, which is likely related to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, as it contains information about `TOTAL_ASSETS`, `TOTAL_LIABILITIES`, and `NET_ASSETS`.

2. **Time Dimension**: The question asks about changes over the last few quarters. However, the schema provided does not explicitly mention a "quarter" column. We might need to infer quarters from the `FILING_DATE` or `REPORT_ENDING_PERIOD` in the `SUBMISSION` table.

3. **Calculating Averages**: We need to calculate the average fund size, which could be based on `NET_ASSETS` or `TOTAL_ASSETS`.

4. **Time-Based Analysis**: To analyze changes over time, we need to group the data by time periods (quarters). This might require a JOIN between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` to access the filing dates.

5. **JOIN Requirement**: Since we need to combine data from `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` to determine the time periods, a JOIN is necessary.

6. **No Nested Queries**: The task does not inherently require nested queries, as we can achieve the desired result using a JOIN and GROUP BY.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query will require a JOIN between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` to access the filing dates and calculate the average fund size over time. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: **
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM filing_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM filing_date) AS quarter,
    AVG(net_assets) AS average_fund_size
FROM 
    fund_reported_info
JOIN 
    submission ON fund_reported_info.accession_number = submission.accession_number
GROUP BY 
    year, quarter
ORDER BY 
    year, quarter;
```

This query will provide the average fund size for each quarter, allowing us to observe changes over the last few quarters.
