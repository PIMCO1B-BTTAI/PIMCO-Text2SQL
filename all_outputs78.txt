classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each investment company manage?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each investment company. This involves counting the number of entries in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table for each unique investment company, which is likely identified by a column such as "CIK" or "REGISTRANT_NAME" in the "REGISTRANT" table.

To achieve this, we need to join the "REGISTRANT" table with the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as the foreign key. This will allow us to group the results by the investment company and count the number of funds they manage.

Since this query involves a JOIN operation between the "REGISTRANT" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" tables, but does not require any nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine how many funds each investment company manages, we need to identify the relationship between investment companies and the funds they manage. The key tables involved in this query are `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`. The `REGISTRANT` table contains information about the investment companies, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the funds, including their series names and IDs.

1. **Identify the Relationship**: The `REGISTRANT` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column. This relationship allows us to associate each fund with its respective investment company.

2. **Count the Funds**: We need to count the number of distinct funds managed by each investment company. This can be done by counting the distinct `SERIES_NAME` or `SERIES_ID` for each `REGISTRANT_NAME`.

3. **Group and Order the Results**: Group the results by `REGISTRANT_NAME` to get the count of funds for each investment company. We can also order the results by the number of funds in descending order to see which companies manage the most funds.

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH FundCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        r.REGISTRANT_NAME,
        f.SERIES_NAME,
        f.SERIES_ID
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT r
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO f ON r.ACCESSION_NUMBER = f.ACCESSION_NUMBER
)
SELECT 
    REGISTRANT_NAME,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_NAME) as Number_of_Funds,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_ID) as Unique_Fund_IDs
FROM 
    FundCounts
GROUP BY 
    REGISTRANT_NAME
ORDER BY 
    Number_of_Funds DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `WITH` clause creates a common table expression (CTE) named `FundCounts` that joins the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column.
  - The main query selects the `REGISTRANT_NAME` and counts the distinct `SERIES_NAME` and `SERIES_ID` to determine the number of funds managed by each investment company.
  - The results are grouped by `REGISTRANT_NAME` and ordered by the number of funds in descending order, with a limit of 10 to show the top 10 companies.
