================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Which registrants have zero liabilities but manage funds?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - We need information from the `registrant` table to get the registrant details.
   - We need information from the `fund_reported_info` table to check the total liabilities.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We need to find registrants with zero liabilities, which means we need to filter `fund_reported_info.total_liabilities = 0`.
   - We need to ensure that these registrants manage funds, which implies there should be a corresponding entry in the `fund_reported_info` table.

3. **Joins**:
   - We need to join the `registrant` table with the `fund_reported_info` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the foreign key to link the registrant with their reported fund information.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since this query requires a join between the `registrant` and `fund_reported_info` tables but does not require any nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".
