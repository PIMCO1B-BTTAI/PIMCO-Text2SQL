classification reasoning: To address the question "Compare how our bond funds performed against equity funds in the last month," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - We need information about the performance of funds, which is likely stored in the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, as it contains monthly total return data.
   - We also need to distinguish between bond funds and equity funds. This categorization might be found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which could contain information about the type of fund or series.

2. **Join Requirements**:
   - To compare bond funds and equity funds, we need to join the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This join will allow us to filter and categorize the funds based on their type (bond or equity).

3. **Data Filtering**:
   - We need to focus on the last month's performance. This requires filtering the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table to get the data for the most recent month.

4. **Comparison Logic**:
   - Once we have the data for bond and equity funds, we can perform a comparison. This might involve calculating average returns, differences, or other statistical measures to compare the performance of the two categories.

Given these steps, the query will involve joining tables and filtering data based on specific conditions. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries, as the comparison can be done using straightforward SQL operations after the join.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a join but does not need nested queries. 

**Label**: "NON-NESTED"

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    asset_cat, 
    AVG(monthly_total_return3) AS average_return_last_month
FROM 
    monthly_total_return
JOIN 
    fund_reported_holding ON monthly_total_return.accession_number = fund_reported_holding.accession_number
WHERE 
    asset_cat IN ('Bond', 'Equity')
GROUP BY 
    asset_cat;
```

This query will provide the average return for bond and equity funds in the last month, allowing for a performance comparison.
