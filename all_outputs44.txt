classification reasoning: To address the question "Compare how our bond funds performed against equity funds in the last month," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - We need to access performance data, which is likely stored in the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table.
   - To differentiate between bond funds and equity funds, we might need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table or another table that categorizes funds.

2. **Joins Required**:
   - We will need to join `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` with a table that provides information about the type of fund (bond or equity). This could be `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` or another related table.
   - The join will likely be on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` since it is a common key across these tables.

3. **Nested Queries**:
   - We might need nested queries if we have to perform separate calculations or aggregations for bond funds and equity funds before comparing them. For example, calculating the average return for each type of fund separately and then comparing these averages.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve both joins and potentially nested queries to perform the necessary comparisons and calculations.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To compare the performance of bond funds against equity funds in the last month, we need to identify the funds categorized as bond or equity and then compare their monthly returns. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Identify bond and equity funds based on their series names.
2. Retrieve the monthly total return for the last month for these funds.
3. Compare the average returns of bond funds against equity funds.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH FundPerformance AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        CASE 
            WHEN F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%BOND%' THEN 'Bond'
            WHEN F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%EQUITY%' THEN 'Equity'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END as Fund_Type,
        M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 as Last_Month_Return
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
        JOIN MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN M ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = M.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%BOND%' OR F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%EQUITY%'
)
SELECT 
    Fund_Type,
    AVG(CAST(Last_Month_Return AS FLOAT)) as Avg_Last_Month_Return,
    COUNT(*) as Fund_Count
FROM 
    FundPerformance
GROUP BY 
    Fund_Type
ORDER BY 
    Avg_Last_Month_Return DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **FundPerformance CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) filters funds into 'Bond' and 'Equity' categories based on their series names and retrieves their last month's return.
- **Main Query**: It calculates the average last month's return for each fund type and counts the number of funds in each category. The results are ordered by the average return in descending order to see which type performed better.
