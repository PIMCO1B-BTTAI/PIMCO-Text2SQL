classification reasoning: To address the query "Show quarterly trends in credit quality for fixed income funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves analyzing credit quality trends, which are likely related to credit spreads. The relevant table for credit spreads is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains columns like `credit_spread_3mon_invest`, `credit_spread_1yr_invest`, etc. Additionally, the `registrant` table is mentioned for quarterly data.

2. **Joins Required**: To show trends over time, particularly quarterly trends, we need to join the `registrant` table with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key. This will allow us to align the credit quality data with the corresponding quarters.

3. **Data Aggregation**: The query requires aggregating data to show trends, which typically involves grouping by time periods (quarters in this case) and calculating averages or other statistics for credit quality metrics.

4. **Classification**: Since the query involves joining multiple tables and aggregating data over time, it requires a JOIN operation but does not necessarily need nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: **
```sql
SELECT registrant.quarter, AVG(fund_reported_info.credit_spread_3mon_invest) AS avg_credit_spread
FROM registrant
JOIN fund_reported_info ON registrant.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
WHERE fund_reported_info.series_name LIKE '%Fixed Income%'
GROUP BY registrant.quarter
ORDER BY registrant.quarter;
```

This query assumes that there is a `quarter` column in the `REGISTRANT` table and that the `SERIES_NAME` in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table can be used to filter for fixed income funds. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual data structure and available columns.
