classification reasoning: To address the query "Show quarterly trends in credit quality for fixed income funds," we need to consider the relevant tables and columns that provide information on credit quality and quarterly trends. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: This table contains columns related to credit spreads, which are indicators of credit quality.
   - `REGISTRANT`: This table provides the `QUARTER` information, which is necessary to analyze trends over time.

2. **Columns of Interest**:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST` and other credit spread columns: These columns provide data on credit quality.
   - `REGISTRANT.QUARTER`: This column is needed to group the data by quarter to observe trends.

3. **Joins Required**:
   - A join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `REGISTRANT` is necessary to link the credit quality data with the corresponding quarter.

4. **Query Type**:
   - The query requires a join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `REGISTRANT` to combine credit quality data with quarterly information.
   - Since the query involves a join but does not require nested queries (like subqueries or set operations), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the query "Show quarterly trends in credit quality for fixed income funds," we need to focus on the credit spreads for investment-grade and non-investment-grade securities. The relevant columns for this analysis are `credit_spread_10yr_invest` and `credit_spread_10yr_noninvest` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. We will group the data by `QUARTER` to observe trends over time.

Hereâ€™s how we can construct the SQL query:

1. **Select the relevant columns**: We need the `QUARTER`, `credit_spread_10yr_invest`, and `credit_spread_10yr_noninvest` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Filter for non-null values**: Ensure that we only consider records where either `credit_spread_10yr_invest` or `credit_spread_10yr_noninvest` is not null.

3. **Group by quarter**: This will allow us to calculate average credit spreads for each quarter.

4. **Calculate averages**: Compute the average credit spread for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade securities for each quarter.

5. **Order the results**: Sort the results by `QUARTER` in descending order to see the most recent trends first.

Here is the SQL query based on the above steps:

```sql
WITH CreditQuality AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        CAST(CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST AS FLOAT) as Investment_Grade,
        CAST(CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST AS FLOAT) as NonInvestment_Grade
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST IS NOT NULL 
        OR CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    AVG(Investment_Grade) as Avg_Investment_Grade_Spread,
    AVG(NonInvestment_Grade) as Avg_NonInvestment_Grade_Spread
FROM 
    CreditQuality
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

This query will provide a quarterly view of the average credit spreads for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade securities, helping to identify trends in credit quality for fixed income funds.
