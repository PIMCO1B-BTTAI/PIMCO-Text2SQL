{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "List all funds managed by registrants in California," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The `REGISTRANT` table is needed to identify registrants located in California.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table is needed to list the funds managed by these registrants.

2. **Join Requirement**:
   - We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This is because the `REGISTRANT` table contains information about the registrant's location, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the funds they manage.
   - The join can be performed using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the foreign key relationship between these two tables.

3. **Conditions**:
   - We need to filter registrants based in California, which involves checking the `STATE` column in the `REGISTRANT` table.

Since this query requires joining two tables but does not require any nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table is crucial as it contains information about the registrants, and we need to filter those based in California.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to link registrants to the funds they manage. This involves understanding the foreign key relationships between 'registrant', 'fund_reported_info', and potentially 'securities_lending'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should use a JOIN operation to connect the 'registrant' table with the 'fund_reported_info' table using the 'accession_number' as the linking key.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The WHERE clause should filter registrants based in California. This requires a condition on the 'registrant' table to check for the state.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we need to select the appropriate columns to display the fund information managed by these registrants.', helpful=True)]
