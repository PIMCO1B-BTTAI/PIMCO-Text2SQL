classification reasoning: To determine which funds are taking on the most interest rate risk, we need to analyze data related to interest rate risk and link it to specific funds. The relevant tables for this query are "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO." 

1. **Identify Interest Rate Risk Data**: The "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" table contains various metrics that quantify interest rate risk, such as changes in portfolio value due to interest rate changes.

2. **Link to Funds**: We need to link this interest rate risk data to specific funds. This can be done using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as a foreign key, which is present in both "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO."

3. **Determine the Most Risk**: To find which funds are taking on the most interest rate risk, we would likely need to aggregate or sort the data based on the interest rate risk metrics.

Since this involves joining data from two tables and potentially aggregating or sorting the data to determine the highest risk, this query requires a JOIN but does not necessarily require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'interest_rate_risk' table seems crucial as it likely contains data on interest rate risk levels.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to link the 'interest_rate_risk' table to the funds. The schema indicates a foreign key relationship between 'interest_rate_risk' and 'fund_reported_info' via 'accession_number'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should consider using a JOIN to connect these tables and extract relevant fund information alongside their interest rate risk levels.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='To identify which funds are taking on the most risk, we should sort the results by the risk level in descending order and possibly limit the results to the top entries.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause might not be necessary unless we need to aggregate data, but sorting by risk level should suffice for identifying the top funds.', helpful=True)]
