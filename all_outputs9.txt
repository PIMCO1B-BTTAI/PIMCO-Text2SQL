classification reasoning: To determine the largest bond funds, we need to identify bond funds and then find those with the largest total assets. This involves:

1. Identifying bond funds, which can be done by checking the asset category in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table where `ASSET_CAT` is related to bonds.
2. Finding the largest funds by comparing their total assets, which is available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

The query will require a join between `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to filter for bond funds and then sort or filter by total assets. This requires a join but not a nested query.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the largest bond funds, we need to identify funds with significant holdings in bonds. The schema does not directly specify a "bond fund" category, so we need to infer this from the data available. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Bond Holdings**: We need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to identify holdings categorized as bonds. This can be done by filtering the `ASSET_CAT` column for entries that represent bonds.

2. **Calculate Fund Size**: For each fund, we need to calculate the total value of its bond holdings. This involves summing the `CURRENCY_VALUE` of holdings identified as bonds.

3. **Rank Funds by Size**: Once we have the total bond holdings for each fund, we can rank them to find the largest bond funds.

4. **Consider Active Funds**: We should ensure that we only consider funds that are still active, which can be checked using the `IS_LAST_FILING` column in the `SUBMISSION` table. Funds with `IS_LAST_FILING = 'N'` are still active.

5. **Join Tables**: We need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table with the `SUBMISSION` table to filter out inactive funds.

Let's create an intermediate representation and then construct the SQL query.

**Intermediate Representation**:
- Select the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and sum of `CURRENCY_VALUE` for holdings categorized as bonds.
- Filter for active funds (`IS_LAST_FILING = 'N'`).
- Group by `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
- Order by the total bond holdings in descending order to find the largest bond funds.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER, SUM(frh.CURRENCY_VALUE) AS total_bond_value
FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING frh
JOIN SUBMISSION s ON frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE frh.ASSET_CAT = 'Bond' AND s.IS_LAST_FILING = 'N'
GROUP BY frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER
ORDER BY total_bond_value DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of the largest bond funds by summing the value of their bond holdings, considering only active funds.
