classification reasoning: To determine the exposure by state and check geographic concentration, we need to analyze the data related to the geographic distribution of registrants. This involves examining the "registrant" table, specifically the "state" column, to understand the distribution of registrants across different states.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "registrant" because it contains the "state" information. We might also need to consider other tables if we want to analyze exposure in terms of financial metrics, but the question specifically asks for geographic concentration.

2. **Joins Needed**: If we were to analyze financial exposure or concentration, we might need to join with tables like "fund_reported_info" to get financial metrics. However, the question focuses on geographic concentration, which can be directly derived from the "registrant" table.

3. **Nested Queries**: The question does not require nested queries as it does not involve complex conditions or subqueries that filter or aggregate data across multiple levels.

Given these considerations, the query primarily involves analyzing data from the "registrant" table without the need for joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
