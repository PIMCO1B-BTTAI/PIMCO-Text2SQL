classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "What's our exposure by state? Need to check geographic concentration," we need to consider the tables and relationships involved:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves the "registrant" table for state information and potentially the "interest_rate_risk" table for exposure details. 

2. **Joins Required**: Since the "registrant" and "interest_rate_risk" tables are linked through the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table via the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" foreign key, a JOIN operation is necessary to combine data from these tables.

3. **Nested Queries**: The query does not explicitly require nested queries, such as using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN, to achieve the desired result.

Given that the query requires a JOIN to combine data from multiple tables but does not require nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the geographic concentration of exposure by state, we need to analyze the data from the `REGISTRANT` table, which contains the `STATE` column. We will also need to consider the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get the total assets or other relevant financial metrics that can indicate exposure. The goal is to aggregate the exposure by state.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - `REGISTRANT`: Contains `STATE` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: Contains `TOTAL_ASSETS` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

2. **Join the Tables**:
   - Use the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to join `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

3. **Aggregate the Data**:
   - Group the data by `STATE` and sum the `TOTAL_ASSETS` to get the exposure for each state.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the state and the total exposure.
   - Use `GROUP BY` to aggregate the data by state.
   - Use `ORDER BY` if you want to sort the results by exposure.

Here's the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH StateExposure AS (
    SELECT 
        R.STATE,
        SUM(CAST(F.TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT)) as Total_Exposure
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F 
            ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        R.STATE IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        R.STATE
)
SELECT 
    STATE,
    Total_Exposure
FROM 
    StateExposure
ORDER BY 
    Total_Exposure DESC;
```

This query calculates the total exposure by state by summing the total assets of funds registered in each state. The results are ordered by the total exposure in descending order to highlight states with the highest exposure.
