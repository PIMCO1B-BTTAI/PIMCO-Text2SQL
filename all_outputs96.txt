================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Where are we seeing the biggest month-over-month changes in fund flows?", we need to analyze the fund flows over different months. The relevant columns for this analysis are likely found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which includes `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, and `SALES_FLOW_MON3`, as well as `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON1`, `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON2`, and `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON3`. These columns represent the sales and redemption flows for each of the three months in the reporting period.

To determine the biggest month-over-month changes, we would need to calculate the differences between these monthly flows. This requires comparing the values across different columns within the same table, which does not necessitate a JOIN operation with other tables. However, it involves calculating differences and possibly using aggregate functions to identify the largest changes.

Since the task involves working with multiple columns within a single table and performing calculations to determine changes, it does not require nested queries or JOINs with other tables. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves straightforward calculations within a single table without the need for complex operations like JOINs or nested queries.
