classification reasoning: The question "Where are we seeing the biggest month-over-month changes in fund flows?" involves analyzing changes in fund flows over time. This requires examining data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the columns related to sales, reinvestment, and redemption flows for each month (`SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON1`, `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON1`, etc.).

To determine the biggest changes, we need to calculate differences between these monthly values. This analysis can be done within a single table without needing to join with other tables, as all relevant data is contained within `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

Since the query involves calculations on columns within a single table and does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To find the biggest month-over-month changes in fund flows, we can analyze the sales, reinvestment, and redemption flows for each month and calculate the differences between consecutive months. Here's a SQL query that does this:
