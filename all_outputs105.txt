================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the query "Compare PIMCO's fixed income duration positioning vs competitors," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Data**: We need to identify the records related to PIMCO. This can be done by filtering the `REGISTRANT` table using the `REGISTRANT_NAME` column to find entries for PIMCO.

2. **Fixed Income Duration Positioning**: This likely involves analyzing interest rate risk or duration-related data. The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table contains information about interest rate changes and their impact on portfolios, which could be relevant for understanding duration positioning.

3. **Competitors' Data**: We need to compare PIMCO's data against its competitors. This involves retrieving similar data for other registrants (excluding PIMCO) and comparing their interest rate risk or duration metrics.

4. **Join and Compare**: To perform this comparison, we will need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key. This will allow us to access both the registrant's name and their interest rate risk data.

5. **Classification**: Since this query involves joining multiple tables (`REGISTRANT` and `INTEREST_RATE_RISK`) and potentially filtering or aggregating data to compare PIMCO with its competitors, it requires a non-trivial SQL query with joins. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries unless specific subqueries are needed for complex filtering or aggregation.

Based on the need for joins and the absence of nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
-- Get PIMCO's interest rate risk data
SELECT irr.ACCESSION_NUMBER, irr.CURRENCY_CODE, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_5YR_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01
FROM INTEREST_RATE_RISK irr
JOIN REGISTRANT r ON irr.ACCESSION_NUMBER = r.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE r.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%';

-- Get competitors' interest rate risk data
SELECT irr.ACCESSION_NUMBER, irr.CURRENCY_CODE, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_5YR_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01, irr.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01
FROM INTEREST_RATE_RISK irr
JOIN REGISTRANT r ON irr.ACCESSION_NUMBER = r.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE r.REGISTRANT_NAME NOT LIKE '%PIMCO%';
```

This SQL will provide the interest rate risk data for PIMCO and its competitors, which can then be analyzed to compare their fixed income duration positioning.
