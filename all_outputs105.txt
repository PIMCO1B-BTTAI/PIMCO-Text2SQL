classification reasoning: The query requires data from two tables: "registrant" for state information and "fund_reported_info" for net assets. To determine states with more than 10 registrants having net assets above the average, we need to:

1. Calculate the average net assets from the "fund_reported_info" table.
2. Filter registrants whose net assets are above this average.
3. Count the number of such registrants per state.
4. Identify states with more than 10 such registrants.

This process involves multiple steps, including aggregation and filtering based on a calculated value (average net assets), which typically requires a nested query. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

This requires filtering the registrants based on the average net assets.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to group the registrants by state and count the number of registrants per state who have net assets above the average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should filter these grouped results to only include states with more than 10 such registrants.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) will help in organizing the query by first calculating the average net assets and then using this result in subsequent calculations.', helpful=True)]
