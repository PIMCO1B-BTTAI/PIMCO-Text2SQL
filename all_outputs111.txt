classification reasoning: The query "Analyze bond maturity distribution across credit ratings" involves analyzing bond maturity dates and their distribution across different credit ratings. To achieve this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `debt_security` for bond maturity dates.
   - `fund_reported_info` for credit spread information, which can be used as a proxy for credit ratings.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `debt_security` with `fund_reported_holding` using the `holding_id` to get the relevant bond information.
   - We also need to join `fund_reported_holding` with `fund_reported_info` using the `accession_number` to access credit spread data.

3. **Analysis**: 
   - The query requires aggregating or analyzing the maturity dates of bonds and categorizing them based on credit ratings derived from credit spread data.

Given these steps, the query involves multiple tables and requires joining them to perform the analysis. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries, as the analysis can be done using joins and aggregations.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires joins but not nested queries.

process_thesql: To analyze the bond maturity distribution across credit ratings, we need to consider the maturity dates of bonds and their associated credit ratings. The relevant tables and columns for this analysis are:

1. **DEBT_SECURITY**: This table contains information about the maturity dates of debt securities.
   - `maturity_date`: The maturity date of the bond.

2. **FUND_REPORTED_INFO**: This table contains information about the credit spreads, which can be used as a proxy for credit ratings.
   - `credit_spread_3mon_invest`: Credit spread for investment-grade bonds with a 3-month maturity.
   - `credit_spread_3mon_noninvest`: Credit spread for non-investment-grade bonds with a 3-month maturity.
   - Similar columns exist for other maturities (1yr, 5yr, 10yr, 30yr).

3. **FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING**: This table links the holdings to the funds.
   - `ACCESSION_NUMBER`: Used to join with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.
   - `HOLDING_ID`: Used to join with `DEBT_SECURITY`.

The goal is to categorize bonds by their maturity (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term) and analyze their distribution across different credit ratings (investment-grade vs. non-investment-grade).

### Intermediate Representation

1. **Join Tables**: Join `DEBT_SECURITY` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` on `HOLDING_ID`, and then join with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` on `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

2. **Categorize Maturities**: Use `maturity_date` to categorize bonds into short-term, medium-term, and long-term.

3. **Determine Credit Rating**: Use credit spread columns to determine if a bond is investment-grade or non-investment-grade.

4. **Aggregate Data**: Count the number of bonds in each maturity category for each credit rating.
