classification reasoning: The query "Identify funds whose cash proportion is higher than the average cash proportion of equity funds" involves comparing the cash proportion of funds to the average cash proportion of a specific category of funds (equity funds). This requires calculating the average cash proportion for equity funds and then comparing each fund's cash proportion to this average.

To achieve this, we need to:
1. Calculate the average cash proportion for equity funds, which involves aggregating data.
2. Compare each fund's cash proportion to this calculated average.

This process involves using a subquery to calculate the average cash proportion of equity funds, which is then used in the main query to filter funds based on this average. Therefore, this query requires a nested query.

So, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The schema information provided does not explicitly mention a table for funds or their cash proportions.
