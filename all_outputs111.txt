classification reasoning: To analyze bond maturity distribution across credit ratings, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The `DEBT_SECURITY` table is necessary to access the `MATURITY_DATE` of bonds.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table might be needed to link the holdings to their respective credit ratings, although the schema provided does not explicitly mention credit ratings. We might assume that credit ratings could be part of the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` or another related table.

2. **Joins Required**:
   - We need to join `DEBT_SECURITY` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` using the `HOLDING_ID` to get the maturity dates and potentially the credit ratings if they are stored in a related table.

3. **Query Type**:
   - Since we need to join at least two tables to get the required information, this query will involve a JOIN operation.

4. **Nested Queries**:
   - If credit ratings are stored in a different table or require additional filtering, a nested query might be necessary. However, based on the provided schema, it seems that a simple join might suffice if credit ratings are directly accessible.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve a JOIN but not necessarily a nested query unless additional filtering or data retrieval is required from other tables. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    ds.maturity_date, 
    CASE 
        WHEN fri.credit_spread_3mon_invest < 50 THEN 'High Credit Quality'
        WHEN fri.credit_spread_3mon_invest BETWEEN 50 AND 150 THEN 'Medium Credit Quality'
        ELSE 'Low Credit Quality'
    END AS credit_rating_category,
    COUNT(ds.holding_id) AS bond_count
FROM 
    debt_security ds
JOIN 
    fund_reported_holding frh ON ds.holding_id = frh.holding_id
JOIN 
    fund_reported_info fri ON frh.accession_number = fri.accession_number
GROUP BY 
    ds.maturity_date, credit_rating_category
ORDER BY 
    ds.maturity_date, credit_rating_category;
```

This query will provide a distribution of bond maturities across different credit rating categories, allowing for an analysis of how bonds are spread across maturity dates and credit quality.
