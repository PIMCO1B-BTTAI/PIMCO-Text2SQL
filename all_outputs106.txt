classification reasoning: To analyze PIMCO's cash management strategy versus its peers, we need to compare data from multiple registrants, specifically focusing on PIMCO and other similar entities. This involves:

1. Identifying PIMCO's data, which requires filtering the "registrant" table for PIMCO's name.
2. Accessing cash management-related data, such as "cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d" from the "fund_reported_info" table.
3. Comparing this data with peers, which involves looking at other registrants' data.

Given these steps, the query will require:

- A JOIN between the "registrant" and "fund_reported_info" tables to access both registrant details and cash management data.
- Filtering for PIMCO and its peers, which may involve additional conditions or subqueries to define what constitutes a peer.

Since the query involves joining tables and potentially complex conditions to define and compare peers, it is classified as "NON-NESTED" if it only involves straightforward joins and conditions. However, if it requires more complex logic or subqueries to define peers or perform the comparison, it could be classified as "NESTED."

In this case, the primary task is to join and filter data, which suggests a "NON-NESTED" classification unless further complexity is introduced. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To analyze PIMCO's cash management strategy versus its peers, we need to compare the cash positions of PIMCO-managed funds with those of other funds. The relevant data is in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` column, which represents cash not reported in categories C or D. We also need to identify PIMCO's funds using the `REGISTRANT` table, which contains the `REGISTRANT_NAME` column.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify PIMCO Funds**: Use the `REGISTRANT` table to filter funds managed by PIMCO.
2. **Calculate Cash Positions**: Extract the cash positions from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for both PIMCO and other funds.
3. **Compare Cash Management**: Calculate average cash positions for PIMCO funds and compare them with the average cash positions of other funds.

### Intermediate Representation

1. **Filter PIMCO Funds**:
   - Join `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
   - Filter where `REGISTRANT_NAME` is 'PIMCO'.

2. **Calculate Average Cash Position**:
   - For PIMCO funds: Calculate the average of `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`.
   - For other funds: Calculate the average of `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the average cash positions of PIMCO funds with those of other funds.

### SQL Query

```sql
WITH PIMCOFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        F.CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
),
OtherFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        F.CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME NOT LIKE '%PIMCO%'
)

SELECT 
    'PIMCO' AS Fund_Manager,
    AVG(CAST(CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D AS FLOAT)) AS Avg_Cash_Position
FROM 
    PIMCOFunds

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Peers' AS Fund_Manager,
    AVG(CAST(CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D AS FLOAT)) AS Avg_Cash_Position
FROM 
    OtherFunds;
```

### Explanation

- **PIMCOFunds CTE**: Filters funds managed by PIMCO and selects their cash positions.
- **OtherFunds CTE**: Filters funds not managed by PIM
