classification reasoning: To analyze PIMCO's cash management strategy versus its peers, we need to gather data from multiple tables and perform comparisons. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Reports**: We need to identify the reports submitted by PIMCO. This involves using the `REGISTRANT` table to find entries where `REGISTRANT_NAME` is PIMCO.

2. **Cash Management Data**: We need to extract cash management-related data, such as `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d`, from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This requires joining the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key.

3. **Peer Comparison**: To compare PIMCO's strategy with its peers, we need similar data for other registrants. This involves querying the same tables for other registrants and comparing the cash management metrics.

4. **Analysis**: The analysis might involve aggregating data, calculating averages, or other statistical measures to compare PIMCO's cash management strategy against its peers.

Given these steps, the query will involve:
- **JOINs**: To combine data from `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables.
- **Filtering**: To select PIMCO and its peers.
- **Aggregation/Comparison**: To analyze and compare the data.

Since the task involves multiple tables and requires JOIN operations, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED." However, if the analysis requires more complex operations like subqueries for specific comparisons, it might lean towards "NESTED." For now, based on the need for JOINs and comparisons, it is "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    r.REGISTRANT_NAME, 
    AVG(fri.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d) AS avg_cash_not_reported
FROM 
    REGISTRANT r
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO fri ON r.ACCESSION_NUMBER = fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY 
    r.REGISTRANT_NAME
HAVING 
    r.REGISTRANT_NAME = 'PIMCO' OR r.REGISTRANT_NAME IN (SELECT DISTINCT REGISTRANT_NAME FROM REGISTRANT WHERE REGISTRANT_NAME != 'PIMCO');
```

This query will provide the average cash not reported in parts C or D for PIMCO and its peers, allowing for a comparative analysis of cash management strategies.
