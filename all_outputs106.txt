classification reasoning: To determine the complexity of the query "Show registrants with the largest portfolio turnover ratio," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: The query requires information about registrants and their portfolio turnover ratio. However, the provided schema does not explicitly mention a "portfolio turnover ratio" column. This suggests that the information might need to be derived or calculated from existing data, or it might be missing from the schema.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins**: If the portfolio turnover ratio is derived from multiple tables, we would need to join those tables. However, without explicit information on where the portfolio turnover ratio is stored or how it is calculated, it's challenging to determine the exact tables involved.

3. **Consider Nested Queries**: If calculating the portfolio turnover ratio requires aggregating data or performing calculations that involve subqueries, then a nested query might be necessary.

Given the lack of explicit information about the portfolio turnover ratio in the schema, we cannot definitively classify the query without additional context. However, if we assume that the ratio is stored in a single table or can be calculated directly from available data without complex subqueries, the query might be classified as "NON-NESTED" if it involves joins, or "EASY" if it doesn't require joins or nested queries.

Since the schema does not provide enough information to determine the exact approach, we can tentatively classify this as "NON-NESTED," assuming that the portfolio turnover ratio can be derived from a straightforward join or calculation. If more information were available, the classification might change.
