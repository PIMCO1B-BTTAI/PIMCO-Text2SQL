      "- The Database combines information from 30 tables of the NPORT dataset from quarter 4 of 2019 to quarter 3 of 2024.\n",
      "- The data includes a comprehensive view of fund-level information, holdings, debt securities, repurchase agreements, and derivative instruments.\n",
      "- Each relation represents detailed information about financial transactions, security holdings, and fund performance, including key identifiers like ACCESSION_NUMBER, HOLDING_ID, and CUSIP for borrowers, holdings, and securities.\n",
      "- The table provides essential metrics like total assets, liabilities, interest rate risks, monthly returns, and details for securities lending and collateral.\n",
