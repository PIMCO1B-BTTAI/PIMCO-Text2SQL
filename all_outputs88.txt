classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find any funds where assets dropped despite positive sales," we need to analyze the data from multiple tables. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: This table contains information about the total assets and sales flow for each fund.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: This table might be relevant if we need to look at specific holdings within the funds.
   - `SECURITIES_LENDING`: This table could be relevant if securities lending impacts the asset values.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We need to identify funds where the total assets have decreased.
   - We also need to ensure that there were positive sales during the period.

3. **Joins and Nested Queries**:
   - A join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` might be necessary to correlate specific holdings with overall fund performance.
   - A nested query might be required to first filter funds with positive sales and then check if their assets have decreased.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve both joins and nested queries to accurately filter and correlate the data across the tables. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To solve the problem of finding funds where assets dropped despite positive sales, we need to compare the net assets of funds across different quarters and check if there was a decrease in net assets while the sales flow was positive. Here's how we can approach this step by step:

1. **Calculate Previous Quarter's Net Assets**: Use a window function to get the net assets from the previous quarter for each fund.

2. **Calculate Total Sales**: Sum up the sales flows for the three months in the current quarter.

3. **Filter Funds**: Identify funds where the current quarter's net assets are less than the previous quarter's net assets, and the total sales are positive.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH FundFlows AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        F.NET_ASSETS,
        LAG(F.NET_ASSETS) OVER (PARTITION BY F.SERIES_ID ORDER BY F.QUARTER) as Prev_Assets,
        (CAST(F.SALES_FLOW_MON1 AS FLOAT) + CAST(F.SALES_FLOW_MON2 AS FLOAT) + CAST(F.SALES_FLOW_MON3 AS FLOAT)) as Total_Sales
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    NET_ASSETS,
    Prev_Assets,
    Total_Sales,
    ((CAST(NET_ASSETS AS FLOAT) - CAST(Prev_Assets AS FLOAT)) / 
     NULLIF(CAST(Prev_Assets AS FLOAT), 0)) * 100 as Asset_Change_Pct
FROM 
    FundFlows
WHERE 
    CAST(NET_ASSETS AS FLOAT) < CAST(Prev_Assets AS FLOAT)
    AND Total_Sales > 0
ORDER BY 
    Asset_Change_Pct;
```

### Explanation:
- **FundFlows CTE**: This common table expression calculates the previous quarter's net assets using the `LAG` function and sums up the sales flows for the current quarter.
- **Main Query**: Filters the funds where the current net assets are less than the previous quarter's net assets and the total sales are positive. It also calculates the percentage change in assets for additional insight.
- **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the percentage change in assets to highlight the most significant drops.
