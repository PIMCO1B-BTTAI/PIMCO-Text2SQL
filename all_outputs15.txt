Schema Links for Question: Which registrants have multiple phone numbers?
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'registrant.accession_number', 'registrant.phone'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which registrants have multiple phone numbers, we need to identify registrants with more than one distinct phone number entry. This requires checking the "registrant" table for duplicate entries based on the "registrant_name" or "accession_number" with different "phone" values. This involves grouping the data by "registrant_name" or "accession_number" and counting the distinct phone numbers for each group. If a registrant has more than one distinct phone number, they have multiple phone numbers.

This task involves using the "registrant" table and requires grouping and counting, but it does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query, which is the 'registrant' table, as it contains the phone numbers and registrant names.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any aggregation is needed. Since we are looking for registrants with multiple phone numbers, we should group by the registrant's accession number and count the distinct phone numbers.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a HAVING clause to filter groups where the count of distinct phone numbers is greater than one, indicating multiple phone numbers.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="No additional joins or complex subqueries are needed because all required information is contained within the 'registrant' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The final query will select the registrant's name and accession number for those with more than one phone number.", helpful=True)]
