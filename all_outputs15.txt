Schema Links for Question: Which registrants have multiple phone numbers?
{'table_columns': ['submission.accession_number', 'registrant.phone', 'registrant.registrant_name'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which registrants have multiple phone numbers, we need to identify registrants with more than one distinct phone number entry. This involves checking the "registrant" table for duplicate entries based on the "registrant_name" or "cik" while having different "phone" numbers. This requires grouping by the registrant identifier and counting distinct phone numbers.

- The query involves only the "registrant" table.
- We need to group by a unique identifier (like "registrant_name" or "cik") and count distinct phone numbers.
- This does not require a JOIN with other tables.
- It does not require nested queries, as we can achieve the result using a GROUP BY and HAVING clause.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
