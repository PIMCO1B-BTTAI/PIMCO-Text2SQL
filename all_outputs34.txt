================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show me the registrants with the most recent filings," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: We need information from the `REGISTRANT` table to get the registrant details and the `SUBMISSION` table to determine the filing dates.

2. **Join Requirement**: Since the `REGISTRANT` and `SUBMISSION` tables are linked by the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, we need to perform a join between these two tables to associate each registrant with their filing date.

3. **Most Recent Filings**: To find the most recent filings, we need to sort the results by the `FILING_DATE` in descending order and possibly limit the results to the top entries, depending on the specific requirement for "most recent."

4. **Classification**: The query requires a join between the `REGISTRANT` and `SUBMISSION` tables but does not require nested queries. Therefore, this query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT registrant_name, filing_date
FROM registrant
JOIN submission ON registrant.accession_number = submission.accession_number
ORDER BY filing_date DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of registrants with their most recent filing dates, ordered from the most recent to the oldest.
