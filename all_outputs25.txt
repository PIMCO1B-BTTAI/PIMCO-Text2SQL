classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with no reported liabilities" involves checking the "fund_reported_info" table for funds where the "total_liabilities" column is zero or null. This requires only a single table, and there is no need for joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_liabilities' column, which is crucial for determining funds with no liabilities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are only interested in funds with no liabilities, we can filter directly on the 'total_liabilities' column without needing joins or aggregations.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter funds where 'total_liabilities' is zero or NULL, as these represent funds with no reported liabilities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Evaluate if a GROUP BY clause is necessary. In this case, it is not needed because we are not aggregating data or needing to group results.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, ensure the SELECT clause retrieves the correct fund identifiers. We should select the primary key or any unique identifier for the funds from the 'fund_reported_info' table.", helpful=True)]
