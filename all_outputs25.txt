================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with no reported liabilities" involves checking the 'total_liabilities' column in the 'fund_reported_info' table to identify funds with zero liabilities. This task requires only a single table, 'fund_reported_info', and does not involve any JOIN operations or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

classification: "EASY"
================================================================================
Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains information about funds and their liabilities. The 'fund_reported_info' table seems to be the primary source for this data.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine the condition for 'no reported liabilities'. This can be achieved by checking if 'total_liabilities' is zero or NULL.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Since we are only interested in funds with no liabilities, we should use a WHERE clause to filter out funds where 'total_liabilities' is greater than zero.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='There is no need for a JOIN or a nested query in this case, as all necessary information is contained within a single table.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The query should simply select the relevant fund identifiers from the 'fund_reported_info' table where 'total_liabilities' is zero or NULL.", helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER FROM fund_reported_info WHERE total_liabilities IS NULL OR total_liabilities = 0;
================================================================================
final_output: SELECT SERIES_NAME FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO WHERE TOTAL_LIABILITIES IS NULL OR TOTAL_LIABILITIES = 0
