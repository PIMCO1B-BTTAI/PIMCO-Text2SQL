================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Show me the largest bond funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question asks for the largest bond funds. This implies we need to look at the fund's total assets to determine size and possibly filter by asset category to identify bond funds.

2. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the fund, including `TOTAL_ASSETS`, which can be used to determine the size of the fund.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains information about the holdings of the fund, including `ASSET_CAT`, which can be used to identify bond funds.

3. **Join Requirement**: To find the largest bond funds, we need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to filter funds by the bond category and then sort by `TOTAL_ASSETS`.

4. **Nested Query Requirement**: The query does not require nested queries (such as using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN) because we can achieve the desired result using a straightforward join and sorting operation.

Based on the above analysis, the query requires a join between two tables but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name" needs to access the "fund_reported_info" table to find funds with 'Growth' in their series name. This can be done using a simple query with a WHERE clause to filter the series names containing 'Growth'. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY".

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Show me the largest bond funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question asks for the largest bond funds. This implies we need to look at the fund's total assets to determine size and the asset category to identify bond funds. The relevant tables would likely include `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for total assets and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` for asset categories.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since we need information from both `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` (for total assets) and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` (to identify bond funds), a JOIN is necessary to combine data from these tables.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not inherently require nested queries like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. We are simply filtering and sorting data based on conditions.

Given these considerations, the query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Income' in their name" needs to identify funds with 'Income' in their name. This information can be found in the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically in the "series_name" column.

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all registrants from Florida" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically filtering by the state of Florida. This can be achieved by using a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter by the state. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying the largest funds that are categorized as bond funds. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the relevant tables: We need information about the funds and their categories. The "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table contains details about the funds, including their total assets, which can help determine the largest funds. The "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table might contain information about the asset category, which can help identify bond funds.

2. Determine the necessary joins: We need to join "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" with "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" to filter funds based on the asset category (bond funds) and then sort or filter by total assets to find the largest ones.

3. Consider if nested queries are needed: If we need to perform a subquery to first filter or rank funds based on their size or category, a nested query might be necessary.

Given these steps, the query will likely involve joining tables to combine fund information with their categories and possibly using a nested query to rank or filter the largest funds. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me the largest bond funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The query is asking for the largest bond funds. This implies we need to look at tables that contain information about funds and their sizes. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains columns like `TOTAL_ASSETS`, which could be used to determine the size of a fund. Additionally, the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table could be used to identify bond funds.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: To find the largest bond funds, we need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to filter for bond funds and then sort or filter by `TOTAL_ASSETS`. This requires a JOIN between these tables based on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `HOLDING_ID` keys.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not inherently require nested queries. We can achieve the desired result using a JOIN and sorting or filtering operations.

Based on this analysis, the query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying the largest funds that are categorized as bond funds. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the table that contains information about funds and their categories. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about funds, including their series name and total assets, which can help determine the largest funds.

2. Identify the table that categorizes the asset type of the holding. The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding, such as bonds.

3. Join these tables to filter and sort the funds based on their total assets and asset category.

Since this involves joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables to filter for bond funds and then sorting them by total assets to find the largest, it requires a join but not a nested query. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
