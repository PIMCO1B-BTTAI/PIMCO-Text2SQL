================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying bond funds and determining their size, likely based on total assets or net assets. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify bond funds, which might involve filtering based on asset categories or series names that indicate bond funds. This information could be in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, possibly under "SERIES_NAME" or "ASSET_CAT" in the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table.

2. Determine the size of these funds, which would involve looking at columns like "TOTAL_ASSETS" or "NET_ASSETS" in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table.

3. Since the question asks for the largest, we would need to sort the results by size and possibly limit the number of results to show only the largest funds.

Given these steps, we would need to join tables to filter and sort the data appropriately. However, the question does not specify a need for nested queries, such as using subqueries to filter or aggregate data across multiple conditions or tables.

Therefore, the SQL query would require JOIN operations to combine data from relevant tables but does not require nested queries. Thus, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying the largest funds that are categorized as bond funds. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the relevant tables: We need information about the funds and their categories. The "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table contains details about the funds, including their total assets, which can help determine the largest funds. The "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table might contain information about the asset category, which can help identify bond funds.

2. Determine the necessary joins: We need to join "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" with "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" to filter funds based on the asset category (bond funds) and then sort or filter by total assets to find the largest ones.

3. Consider if nested queries are needed: If we need to perform a subquery to first filter or rank funds based on their size or category, a nested query might be necessary.

Given these steps, the query will likely involve joining tables to combine fund information with their categories and possibly using a nested query to rank or filter the largest funds. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me the largest bond funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The query is asking for the largest bond funds. This implies we need to look at tables that contain information about funds and their sizes. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains columns like `TOTAL_ASSETS`, which could be used to determine the size of a fund. Additionally, the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table could be used to identify bond funds.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: To find the largest bond funds, we need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to filter for bond funds and then sort or filter by `TOTAL_ASSETS`. This requires a JOIN between these tables based on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `HOLDING_ID` keys.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not inherently require nested queries. We can achieve the desired result using a JOIN and sorting or filtering operations.

Based on this analysis, the query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying the largest funds that are categorized as bond funds. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the table that contains information about funds and their categories. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about funds, including their series name and total assets, which can help determine the largest funds.

2. Identify the table that categorizes the asset type of the holding. The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding, such as bonds.

3. Join these tables to filter and sort the funds based on their total assets and asset category.

Since this involves joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables to filter for bond funds and then sorting them by total assets to find the largest, it requires a join but not a nested query. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
