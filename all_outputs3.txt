classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each registrant have?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each registrant. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the registrant using the "REGISTRANT" table.
2. Count the number of funds associated with each registrant. This information is likely stored in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, which is linked to the "REGISTRANT" table through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" foreign key.

Since we need to join the "REGISTRANT" table with the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to count the funds for each registrant, this query requires a JOIN operation. However, it does not require any nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine how many funds each registrant has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need the `REGISTRANT` table to get the `REGISTRANT_NAME`.
   - We need the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get the `SERIES_NAME` or `SERIES_ID` which represents individual funds.

2. **Establish the Relationship**:
   - The `REGISTRANT` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column. This is evident from the foreign key relationship: `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Count the Number of Funds for Each Registrant**:
   - We will join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
   - We will then group the results by `REGISTRANT_NAME` and count the distinct `SERIES_NAME` or `SERIES_ID` for each registrant.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - The SQL query will select the `REGISTRANT_NAME` and count the distinct `SERIES_NAME` or `SERIES_ID` from the joined tables, grouped by `REGISTRANT_NAME`.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    R.REGISTRANT_NAME,
    COUNT(DISTINCT F.SERIES_NAME) AS Number_of_Funds
FROM 
    REGISTRANT R
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY 
    R.REGISTRANT_NAME
ORDER BY 
    Number_of_Funds DESC;
```

This query will provide the number of funds each registrant manages, ordered by the number of funds in descending order.
