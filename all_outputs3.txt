classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying the largest funds that are categorized as bond funds. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the table that contains information about funds and their categories. This is likely the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which includes details about the fund's series name and total assets.

2. Determine the asset category for bond funds. This information might be found in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which categorizes asset types.

3. Join these tables to filter and sort the funds based on their total assets to find the largest ones.

Since this involves joining tables to combine information about fund categories and their total assets, but does not require nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To generate the SQL query for the question "Show me the largest bond funds," we need to identify the relevant tables and columns that can help us determine the size of bond funds. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about funds, including `TOTAL_ASSETS`, which can be used to determine the size of a fund.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains information about the holdings of the fund, including `ASSET_CAT`, which categorizes the asset type of the holding. We need to filter for bond funds.

2. **Determine the Criteria for "Largest":**
   - "Largest" typically refers to the size of the fund in terms of total assets. Therefore, we will use the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column to determine the largest funds.

3. **Filter for Bond Funds:**
   - We need to filter the holdings to include only those categorized as bonds. This can be done by checking the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table for bond-related categories.

4. **Join Tables:**
   - We will join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to ensure we are looking at the correct holdings for each fund.

5. **Order and Limit Results:**
   - We will order the results by `TOTAL_ASSETS` in descending order to get the largest funds and limit the results to a reasonable number, such as the top 10 largest bond funds.

Here is the SQL query based on the above reasoning:

```sql
WITH BondFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        FRI.SERIES_NAME, 
        FRI.TOTAL_ASSETS
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH ON FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        FRH.ASSET_CAT = 'Bond'  -- Assuming 'Bond' is the category for bond funds
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME, 
    TOTAL_ASSETS
FROM 
    BondFunds
ORDER BY 
    TOTAL_ASSETS DESC
LIMIT 10;  -- Adjust the limit as needed
```

**Explanation:**
- **CTE (Common Table Expression) `BondFunds`:** This CTE filters the funds to include only those with holdings categorized as bonds.
- **Join:** The `JOIN` operation links the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables using `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
- **WHERE Clause:** Filters the holdings to include only those categorized as bonds.
- **ORDER BY and LIMIT:** Orders the results by `TOTAL_ASSETS` in descending order and limits the output to the top 10 largest bond funds. Adjust the limit as needed based on the requirement.
