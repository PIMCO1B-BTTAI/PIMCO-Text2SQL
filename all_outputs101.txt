classification reasoning: The question "How diverse are our income sources across the portfolio?" is quite broad and requires an analysis of various income sources. To address this, we would need to examine multiple tables that could contribute to income, such as "fund_reported_info" for delayed delivery and "securities_lending" for loans by the fund. 

Given the schema, we would likely need to join these tables to get a comprehensive view of income sources. Additionally, the question might require aggregating or analyzing data across different categories, which could involve nested queries to calculate diversity metrics or distributions.

Therefore, the SQL query to answer this question would likely involve both JOIN operations to combine data from different tables and potentially nested queries to perform the necessary analysis. As a result, the query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the question "How diverse are our income sources across the portfolio?", we need to analyze the different sources of income such as fixed income, floating income, and securities lending income across the portfolio. This involves aggregating data from multiple tables and calculating the percentage of each income source relative to the total assets of each fund.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify Income Sources**: We need to consider fixed income from fixed-rate bonds, floating income from floating-rate bonds, and income from securities lending.

2. **Join Relevant Tables**: We will join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, `DEBT_SECURITY`, and `SECURITIES_LENDING` tables to gather all necessary data.

3. **Calculate Income Percentages**: For each fund, calculate the percentage of total assets that each income source represents.

4. **Aggregate and Group Data**: Group the data by fund series to get a comprehensive view of income diversity.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:
