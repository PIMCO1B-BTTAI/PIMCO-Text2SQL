Schema Links for Question: How diverse are our income sources across the portfolio?
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine how diverse the income sources are across the portfolio, we need to analyze various tables that provide information about different types of income-generating activities. This could include securities lending, derivatives, interest rate risks, and other financial instruments. 

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - **SECURITIES_LENDING**: Provides information on whether the fund is involved in securities lending.
   - **DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY**: Contains details about derivative transactions.
   - **INTEREST_RATE_RISK**: Offers insights into interest rate risk exposure.
   - **FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING**: Gives an overview of the holdings in the portfolio.

2. **Determine Relationships**: 
   - We need to join these tables based on common keys, such as `HOLDING_ID` or `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, to gather comprehensive data on income sources.

3. **Assess Diversity**: 
   - Calculate the proportion of income from each source (e.g., securities lending, derivatives, interest) relative to the total income.

Given the need to join multiple tables to gather data on different income sources and assess their diversity, this query requires a complex structure involving multiple joins. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries unless specific conditions or subqueries are needed to filter or aggregate data.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves multiple joins but does not inherently require nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT holding_id) AS num_securities_lending_holdings
FROM securities_lending
WHERE is_loan_by_fund = 'Y';
```

This query counts the number of distinct holdings where the fund is the lender, providing insight into the diversity of income sources from securities lending within the portfolio. To fully assess income diversity, similar queries would need to be constructed for other income sources.
