================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name" needs to access the "fund_reported_info" table to filter funds based on their names. Specifically, we are interested in the "series_name" column to find names containing the word "Growth." This operation can be performed using a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter the names. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY." 

Label: "EASY"

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="The main table of interest is 'fund_reported_info' because it contains the 'series_name' column, which likely holds the fund names.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to filter the 'series_name' column to find entries that contain the word 'Growth'. This can be done using a WHERE clause with a LIKE operator.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='No complex joins or aggregations are necessary because the query only requires filtering based on a single column in one table.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The query does not require any Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or nested queries because the task is straightforward and involves a simple filter operation.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The SQL query will be structured to select the 'series_name' from 'fund_reported_info' where 'series_name' contains 'Growth'.", helpful=True)]
