classification reasoning: The query "Compare fixed vs floating rate bond distribution across credit qualities" involves analyzing data related to bond types (fixed or floating) and their distribution across different credit qualities. To achieve this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `nonforeign_exchange_swap` for fixed or floating rate information.
   - `fund_reported_info` for credit spread information, which can be used as a proxy for credit quality.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `nonforeign_exchange_swap` with `fund_reported_info` to relate the bond type with credit quality information. This requires a join on the `holding_id` which is a foreign key relationship between `nonforeign_exchange_swap` and `fund_reported_holding`, and subsequently with `fund_reported_info`.

3. **Analysis**: 
   - The query requires aggregating or comparing data across different categories (fixed vs floating) and credit qualities, which typically involves grouping and possibly aggregating data.

Given these considerations, the query requires joining multiple tables to gather the necessary data for analysis. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries, as the task can be accomplished with straightforward joins and aggregations.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: **
   - Use a `CASE` statement to categorize bonds as fixed or floating.
   - Group the results by credit quality and bond type to get the distribution.

Here is the SQL query that implements the above steps:
