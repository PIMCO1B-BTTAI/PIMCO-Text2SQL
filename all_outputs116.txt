classification reasoning: The query requires comparing the total liabilities of each state to the average liabilities across all states. This involves calculating the average liabilities, which is an aggregate function, and then comparing each state's total liabilities to this average. This process typically requires a subquery to calculate the average, followed by a comparison in the main query. Therefore, the SQL query will involve a nested query to achieve this comparison. So, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The relevant tables are 'fund_reported_info' for total liabilities and 'registrant' for state information.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to join 'fund_reported_info' and 'registrant' on the 'ACCESSION_NUMBER' to associate liabilities with states.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to calculate the average total liabilities across all states. This requires an aggregation function (AVG) over the 'total_liabilities' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='To find states with total liabilities higher than the average, we will use a nested query. The inner query calculates the average, and the outer query filters states based on this average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause. The outer query will filter states where the sum of total liabilities is greater than the average calculated in the inner query.', helpful=True)]
