classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have zero liabilities?" requires us to identify funds with a specific financial condition, namely zero liabilities. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The table `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` contains the column `TOTAL_LIABILITIES`, which is directly relevant to the query.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since the question is only asking about funds with zero liabilities, and this information is contained within a single table (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO`), there is no need to join with other tables.

3. **Assess the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not require any complex operations such as subqueries, intersections, or unions. It is a straightforward filter operation on a single table.

Given these points, the query can be executed by simply filtering the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for records where `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` equals zero. This does not require any JOINs or nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
