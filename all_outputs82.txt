classification reasoning: The query "Which USD funds are most exposed to interest rate changes?" involves analyzing data related to interest rate risk and potentially linking it to specific funds. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` for interest rate change data.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to identify funds and their currency (USD).

2. **Join Requirement**: 
   - We need to join `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using the foreign key `INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER` to filter for USD funds.

3. **Nested Query Requirement**: 
   - The query does not explicitly require a nested query. We can achieve the desired result by joining the tables and filtering based on the currency and interest rate exposure.

Since the query requires a join between `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` but does not require a nested query, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine which USD funds are most exposed to interest rate changes, we need to focus on the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table, which contains information about interest rate changes and their impact on funds. We will filter for funds that are denominated in USD and have significant interest rate risk exposure.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need to look at columns related to interest rate changes, such as `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_5YR_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01`, and `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01`.

2. **Filter for USD Funds**: We need to ensure that we are only considering funds that are denominated in USD. This can be done by checking the `CURRENCY_CODE` column in the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table.

3. **Calculate Exposure**: We can calculate the total interest rate risk exposure by summing up the DV01 values for different maturities.

4. **Join with Fund Information**: We may need to join with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get additional details about the funds, such as their names or total assets, if needed.

5. **Order by Exposure**: Finally, we will order the results by the calculated exposure to identify the most exposed funds.

Here is the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH InterestRateExposure AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        IR.CURRENCY_CODE,
        CAST(IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01 AS FLOAT) +
        CAST(IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01 AS FLOAT) +
        CAST(IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_5YR_DV01 AS FLOAT) +
        CAST(IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01 AS FLOAT) +
        CAST(IR.INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_30YR_DV01 AS FLOAT) AS Total_Interest_Rate_Risk
    FROM 
        INTEREST_RATE_RISK IR
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON IR.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        IR.CURRENCY_CODE = 'USD'
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    Total_Interest_Rate_Risk
FROM 
    InterestRateExposure
ORDER BY 
    Total_Interest_Rate_Risk DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query calculates the total interest rate risk for each USD fund by summing the DV01 values across different maturities and orders the results to show the funds with the highest exposure.
