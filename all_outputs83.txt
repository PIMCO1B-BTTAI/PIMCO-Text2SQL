classification reasoning: To answer the question "Identify registrants whose states have the most funds," we need to determine which state has the highest number of funds and then identify the registrants in that state. This involves multiple steps:

1. **Count the number of funds per state**: We need to aggregate data to count the number of funds associated with each state. This requires joining the `registrant` table with the `fund_reported_info` table to link registrants to their respective funds.

2. **Identify the state with the most funds**: After counting the funds per state, we need to find the state with the maximum count.

3. **Identify registrants in that state**: Once we have the state with the most funds, we need to filter the registrants who are located in that state.

This process involves joining tables and performing aggregation, which requires a nested query to first determine the state with the most funds and then use that result to filter registrants. Therefore, the SQL query for this question would be classified as "NESTED."

The 'securities_lending' table has a column 'is_loan_by_fund' which might indicate fund-related data.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the total number of funds per state. This will simplify the main query.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause is necessary to aggregate the data by state and count the number of funds associated with each state.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we need to filter the results to only include states with the maximum number of funds.
