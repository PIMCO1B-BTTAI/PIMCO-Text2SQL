classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all registrants and their cities" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically the columns "registrant_name" and "city." Since all the required information is contained within a single table, there is no need for a JOIN operation. Additionally, the query does not require any nested queries, as it is a straightforward selection of columns from a single table. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
