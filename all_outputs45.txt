classification reasoning: To determine which investment firms are growing the fastest based on their asset growth, we need to analyze the data over time. This involves comparing the total assets of firms across different reporting periods. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - We need data on total assets, which is available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.
   - To identify the investment firms, we need the `REGISTRANT` table, which contains the registrant names and CIKs.

2. **Determine Growth**:
   - We need to calculate the growth in total assets over time. This requires comparing total assets from different reporting periods.
   - We can use the `FILING_DATE` or `REPORT_ENDING_PERIOD` from the `SUBMISSION` table to determine the time frame for asset growth.

3. **Join Tables**:
   - We need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `REGISTRANT` table to get the names of the firms.
   - We also need to join with the `SUBMISSION` table to get the filing dates for calculating growth over time.

4. **Calculate Growth**:
   - We can calculate the growth rate by comparing the total assets at different points in time for each firm.

Given these steps, the query will involve multiple joins and calculations over time, which suggests the need for a more complex query structure, possibly involving subqueries or window functions to calculate growth rates.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED" due to the need for complex calculations and multiple table joins to determine asset growth over time.

process_thesql: To determine which investment firms are growing the fastest based on their asset growth, we need to analyze the change in total assets over time. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the total assets of funds, which can be used to assess growth.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column, which indicates the value of the fund's assets.
   - We also need the `REGISTRANT` table to get the `REGISTRANT_NAME`, which represents the investment firm.

2. **Calculate Asset Growth**:
   - To calculate growth, we need to compare the total assets at different points in time. This requires data from multiple filings, which can be identified using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `FILING_DATE` from the `SUBMISSION` table.

3. **Join Tables**:
   - Join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `REGISTRANT` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the firm names.
   - Join with the `SUBMISSION` table to get the filing dates for calculating growth over time.

4. **Calculate Growth Rate**:
   - Calculate the growth rate of total assets for each firm over the available periods. This can be done by comparing the total assets from the latest filing to an earlier filing.

5. **Order by Growth Rate**:
   - Order the results by the calculated growth rate in descending order to identify the fastest-growing firms.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT r.REGISTRANT_NAME, 
       (f1.TOTAL_ASSETS - f2.TOTAL_ASSETS) / f2.TOTAL_ASSETS * 100 AS ASSET_GROWTH_PERCENTAGE
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO f1
JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO f2 ON f1.ACCESSION_NUMBER <> f2.ACCESSION_NUMBER
JOIN REGISTRANT r ON f1.ACCESSION_NUMBER = r.ACCESSION_NUMBER
JOIN SUBMISSION s1 ON f1.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s1.ACCESSION_NUMBER
JOIN SUBMISSION s2 ON f2.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s2.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE r.ACCESSION_NUMBER = f1.ACCESSION_NUMBER
AND s1.FILING_DATE > s2.FILING_DATE
AND r.ACCESSION_NUMBER = f2.ACCESSION_NUMBER
ORDER BY ASSET_GROWTH_PERCENTAGE DESC;
```

**Explanation**:
- We join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with itself to compare different filings (`f1` and `f2`).
- We join with the `REGISTRANT` table to get the firm names.
- We join with the `SUBMISSION` table to ensure we are comparing filings from different dates.
- We calculate the growth percentage using the formula: \((\text{Latest Total Assets} - \text{Earlier Total Assets}) / \text{Earlier Total Assets} \times 100\).
- Finally, we order the results by the growth percentage in descending order to find the fastest-growing firms.
