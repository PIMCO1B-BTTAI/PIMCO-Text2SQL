classification reasoning: To answer the question "Compare how our bond funds performed against equity funds in the last month," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We need to identify which tables contain information about fund performance and categorize funds as bond or equity.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table might contain information about the type of fund (e.g., bond or equity) through the `ASSET_CAT` column.
   - The `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table contains performance data for funds, specifically the monthly total returns.

2. **Determine Relationships**:
   - We need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table to get the performance data for each fund type.
   - The relationship between these tables is through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` primary key.

3. **Filter for the Last Month**:
   - We need to filter the data to only include performance data for the last month. This would typically involve selecting the most recent entry in the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table.

4. **Comparison**:
   - We need to compare the performance of bond funds against equity funds. This involves aggregating or summarizing the performance data for each fund type and then comparing these summaries.

Given these steps, the query will require joining tables and filtering data based on specific conditions. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries, as the comparison can be done using aggregate functions and conditional logic within a single query.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves JOIN operations but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: To address the query "Compare how our bond funds performed against equity funds in the last month," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to compare the performance of bond funds and equity funds. The `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table contains monthly return data, which is crucial for performance comparison.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding (e.g., equities, bonds).

2. **Join Tables**:
   - We will join the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to filter out the funds based on their asset category (bonds or equities).

3. **Filter for the Last Month**:
   - We will use the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3` column from the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, assuming it represents the most recent month's return.

4. **Group and Aggregate Data**:
   - We will group the data by `ASSET_CAT` to calculate the average return for bond funds and equity funds separately.

5. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - We will use a `WITH` clause to create a common table expression (CTE) for clarity and to avoid nested queries.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
WITH FundPerformance AS (
    SELECT 
        FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        FRH.ASSET_CAT,
        MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS Last_Month_Return
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH
    JOIN 
        MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN MTR ON FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER = MTR.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        FRH.ASSET_CAT IN ('bonds', 'equities')
)
SELECT 
    ASSET_CAT,
    AVG(CAST(Last_Month_Return AS FLOAT)) AS Average_Last_Month_Return
FROM 
    FundPerformance
GROUP BY 
    ASSET_CAT;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (FundPerformance)**: This CTE selects the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `ASSET_CAT`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3` (representing the last month's return) for funds categorized as either 'bonds' or 'equities'.
- **Main Query**: The main query calculates the average return for the last month for each asset category (bonds and equities) by grouping the results by `ASSET_CAT`.
- **CAST Function**: The `CAST` function is used to ensure that the return values are treated as numeric for averaging.

This query will provide a comparison of the average performance of bond funds versus equity funds for the most recent month.
