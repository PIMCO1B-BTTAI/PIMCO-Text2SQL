classification reasoning: To address the question "Identify registrants managing funds with the highest cash proportion in their state," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `registrant`: To get the registrant details and their state.
   - `fund_reported_info`: To get the cash proportion, which can be derived from `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` and other relevant financial metrics.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `registrant` and `fund_reported_info` on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link registrants with their respective fund information.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Calculate the cash proportion for each fund. This might involve using `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` and comparing it to total assets or net assets to determine the proportion of cash.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - Group by state to find the highest cash proportion for each state. This requires aggregation to determine the maximum cash proportion within each state.

5. **Nested Queries**:
   - A nested query might be necessary to first calculate the cash proportion for each fund and then find the maximum within each state.

Given these steps, the query involves joining tables and potentially using nested queries to perform calculations and aggregations. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for the query. The 'registrant' table is essential as it contains the registrant's name and state. The 'fund_reported_info' table is also crucial as it contains the cash proportion data.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to calculate the cash proportion for each fund. This involves using the 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' column from the 'fund_reported_info' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the maximum cash proportion for each state. This will help in identifying the registrants with the highest cash proportion in their respective states.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="A nested query will be used to filter the registrants who have the maximum cash proportion in their state. This involves joining the CTE with the 'registrant' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we need to ensure that the query is structured to select the registrant's name and state, filtering by the maximum cash proportion calculated in the CTE.", helpful=True)]
