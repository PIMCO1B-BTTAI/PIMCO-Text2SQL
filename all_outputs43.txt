Schema Links for Question: What's the latest filing date for each fund?
{'table_columns': ['submission.filing_date', 'submission.filing_date', 'submission.is_last_filing', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}

classification reasoning: The question "What's the latest filing date for each fund?" requires us to determine the most recent filing date for each fund. This involves grouping the data by fund and then selecting the maximum filing date for each group. The relevant table for this query is "submission," as it contains the "filing_date" and "accession_number" (which can be used to identify each fund).

To achieve this, we need to perform a grouping operation and use an aggregate function (MAX) to find the latest filing date for each fund. This operation does not require joining multiple tables, nor does it require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'submission' table is crucial as it contains the 'filing_date' which we need to find the latest of for each fund.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to determine how to group the data. Since we want the latest filing date for each fund, we should group by the fund identifier, which is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use an aggregation function to find the latest date. The MAX() function is appropriate for finding the latest date within each group.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider if any joins are necessary. Based on the schema information, there is no direct mention of a fund identifier in the 'submission' table, so we assume each submission is uniquely tied to a fund.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, structure the SQL query to select the maximum filing date for each fund, using GROUP BY to ensure we get the latest date per fund.', helpful=True)]
