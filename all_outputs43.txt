classification reasoning: The question "What's the latest filing date for each fund?" requires us to determine the most recent filing date for each fund. This involves:

1. Identifying the relevant table: The "submission" table contains the "filing_date" and "accession_number" which can be used to identify each unique submission.

2. Grouping by fund: We need to group the data by a unique identifier for each fund. In this case, the "accession_number" can be used to identify each unique submission, but if we need to group by fund, we might need to consider additional identifiers from related tables like "fund_reported_info" which might have series or fund identifiers.

3. Aggregating the data: We need to find the maximum filing date for each group, which requires an aggregation function.

4. No nested queries are needed: This task can be accomplished using a simple aggregation with a GROUP BY clause, without requiring nested queries.

5. No JOINs are needed: If we assume that each "accession_number" corresponds to a unique fund, we can directly use the "submission" table without needing to join with other tables.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query does not require nested queries or JOINs, so it can be classified as "EASY."
