classification reasoning: To determine the quarterly pattern of fund cash positions, we need to analyze the cash-related data over time. The relevant table for cash positions is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, specifically the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` column, which represents cash holdings or equivalents not categorized in specific asset parts.

However, the question asks for a "quarterly pattern," which implies a need to aggregate or analyze data over time, specifically by quarters. The schema does not explicitly mention a "quarter" column, but it does have filing dates and report dates in the `SUBMISSION` table, which can be used to determine the quarter.

To achieve this, we would need to:
1. Extract the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` from `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.
2. Use the `FILING_DATE` or `REPORT_DATE` from the `SUBMISSION` table to determine the quarter for each entry.
3. Aggregate the cash positions by quarter to identify patterns.

This process involves joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `SUBMISSION` table to access the date information needed to determine the quarter. Therefore, this query requires a JOIN but does not necessarily require nested queries.

Thus, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT registrant.quarter, 
       SUM(fund_reported_info.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d) AS total_cash_position, 
       COUNT(securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund) AS loan_count
FROM registrant
JOIN fund_reported_info ON registrant.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
JOIN fund_reported_holding ON fund_reported_info.accession_number = fund_reported_holding.accession_number
JOIN securities_lending ON fund_reported_holding.holding_id = securities_lending.holding_id
GROUP BY registrant.quarter;
```

This query will provide the quarterly pattern of fund cash positions by summing the cash not reported in specific asset parts and counting the number of loans by the fund for each quarter.
