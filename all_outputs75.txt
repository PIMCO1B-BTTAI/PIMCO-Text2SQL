classification reasoning: The question "What's the quarterly pattern of fund cash positions?" involves analyzing the cash positions of funds over different quarters. To achieve this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for the cash positions (`cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d`).
   - `REGISTRANT` for the quarter information (`quarter`).

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `REGISTRANT` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the quarterly data.

3. **Query Type**:
   - Since we need to join two tables to get the required information, this query involves a JOIN operation.

4. **Nested Queries**:
   - The query does not require any nested operations like subqueries or set operations (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN).

Based on the above analysis, the query requires a JOIN but does not need nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the quarterly pattern of fund cash positions, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` column, which represents the cash position of the funds. We will group the data by the `QUARTER` column to analyze the pattern over time. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Select the Relevant Columns**: We need the `QUARTER` and `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Filter Non-Null Values**: Ensure that we only consider records where `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` is not null, as null values would not contribute to the analysis.

3. **Aggregate the Data**: Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum cash positions for each quarter to understand the pattern.

4. **Group by Quarter**: Group the results by the `QUARTER` column to see the changes over time.

5. **Order the Results**: Order the results by `QUARTER` in descending order to see the most recent data first.

Now, let's construct the SQL query based on this plan:

```sql
WITH CashPositions AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        CAST(CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D AS FLOAT) as Cash_Position
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    AVG(Cash_Position) as Avg_Cash_Position,
    MAX(Cash_Position) as Max_Cash_Position,
    MIN(Cash_Position) as Min_Cash_Position
FROM 
    CashPositions
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

This query will provide the average, maximum, and minimum cash positions for each quarter, allowing us to observe the quarterly pattern of fund cash positions.
