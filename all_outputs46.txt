Schema Links for Question: Show me all Fidelity funds
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the complexity of the SQL query needed to answer the question "Show me all Fidelity funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to find funds associated with "Fidelity." This likely involves looking at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `SERIES_NAME` or `REGISTRANT_NAME` in the `REGISTRANT` table, to identify funds related to Fidelity.

2. **Determine if a JOIN is Needed**:
   - If "Fidelity" is part of the `SERIES_NAME` in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, we can directly query this table without needing a JOIN.
   - If "Fidelity" is part of the `REGISTRANT_NAME` in the `REGISTRANT` table, and we need to link it to the funds, we would need to JOIN `REGISTRANT` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Determine if a Nested Query is Needed**:
   - If the information can be retrieved directly from one table or through a simple JOIN, a nested query is not necessary.

Given these considerations, if "Fidelity" can be directly identified in the `SERIES_NAME` or `REGISTRANT_NAME` without needing to filter based on complex conditions or subqueries, the query would be classified as "NON-NESTED" if a JOIN is required, or "EASY" if it can be done with a single table.

Since the question does not specify complex conditions or require filtering beyond identifying "Fidelity" funds, and assuming "Fidelity" can be found directly in one of the tables, the query can be classified as "EASY" if no JOIN is needed, or "NON-NESTED" if a JOIN is required to link `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

**Conclusion**: Without specific details on where "Fidelity" is located, if it can be found directly in `SERIES_NAME`, the query is "EASY." If it requires linking `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, it is "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The table 'securities_lending' is mentioned in the schema, which likely contains information about funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. The foreign key relationship suggests that 'securities_lending' can be joined with 'fund_reported_holding' to get more details about the funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to identify the column that indicates a fund is a Fidelity fund. The column 'is_loan_by_fund' might contain this information, but we need to ensure it specifically identifies Fidelity funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter the results to only include Fidelity funds, which might require a specific value in the 'is_loan_by_fund' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, determine if a group_by clause is required. Since the query is straightforward and only asks for Fidelity funds, a group_by clause is not necessary.', helpful=True)]
