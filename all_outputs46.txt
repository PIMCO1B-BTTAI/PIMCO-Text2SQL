classification reasoning: To address the question "Any funds that seem to be taking on more risk lately? Look at their borrowing trends," we need to analyze borrowing trends over time to identify any increases that might indicate higher risk-taking. This involves examining data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the columns related to borrowing, such as `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains information about borrowing trends.

2. **Data Analysis**: We need to compare borrowing amounts over different periods to identify trends. This might involve looking at changes in borrowing amounts over consecutive filings or periods.

3. **JOINs and Nested Queries**: 
   - Since the question focuses on borrowing trends, we primarily need data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. 
   - If we were to compare borrowing trends with other risk indicators or across different funds, we might need to join with other tables like `SUBMISSION` for filing dates or `REGISTRANT` for fund identification.
   - However, the core of the analysis is within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, and we can perform this analysis without requiring nested queries or complex joins.

Given the focus on a single table and the absence of a need for nested queries or joins with other tables, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
