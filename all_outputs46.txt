classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Any funds that seem to be taking on more risk lately? Look at their borrowing trends," we need to analyze the schema links and the relationships between the tables involved.

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves examining borrowing trends, which suggests the use of the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for borrowing data (`borrowing_pay_within_1yr`) and potentially the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table for risk assessment. Additionally, the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table might be relevant for understanding if funds are loaning securities, which could indicate risk-taking behavior.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table is linked to the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` foreign key.
   - The `SECURITIES_LENDING` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table through the `HOLDING_ID`, which in turn is linked to `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` through `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Nested Queries**: The query might require nested queries if we need to perform complex filtering or aggregation to determine trends over time or compare current borrowing levels to past levels. However, if the query is simply about retrieving current borrowing levels and risk indicators, it might not require nested queries.

process_thesql: To identify funds that seem to be taking on more risk lately by examining their borrowing trends, we can analyze the borrowing amounts over recent quarters and look for significant increases. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Calculate the borrowing amounts for each fund over the last few quarters.
2. Determine the change in borrowing amounts over time.
3. Identify funds with significant increases in borrowing, indicating a potential increase in risk.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH BorrowingTrends AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        F.QUARTER,
        (CAST(F.BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR AS FLOAT) + CAST(F.BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Borrowing,
        LAG((CAST(F.BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR AS FLOAT) + CAST(F.BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR AS FLOAT))) OVER (PARTITION BY F.SERIES_NAME ORDER BY F.QUARTER) AS Previous_Borrowing
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    WHERE 
        F.BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR IS NOT NULL
        AND F.BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR IS NOT NULL
),
BorrowingIncrease AS (
    SELECT 
        SERIES_NAME,
        QUARTER,
        Total_Borrowing,
        Previous_Borrowing,
        (Total_Borrowing - Previous_Borrowing) AS Borrowing_Change
    FROM 
        BorrowingTrends
    WHERE 
        Previous_Borrowing IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    QUARTER,
    Total_Borrowing,
    Previous_Borrowing,
    Borrowing_Change
FROM 
    BorrowingIncrease
WHERE 
    Borrowing_Change > 0
ORDER BY 
    Borrowing_Change DESC;
```

This query uses a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the total borrowing for each fund and compares it to the previous quarter's borrowing. It then filters for funds where the borrowing has increased, indicating a potential increase in risk. The results are ordered by the magnitude of the borrowing change to highlight the most significant increases.
