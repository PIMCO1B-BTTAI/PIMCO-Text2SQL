Schema Links for Question: Show me all Fidelity funds.
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the complexity of the SQL query needed to answer the question "Show me all Fidelity funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to identify which table contains information about funds and their names. The table `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` contains the `SERIES_NAME`, which likely includes the name of the fund.
   - We need to filter funds by the name "Fidelity," which suggests a condition on the `SERIES_NAME` column.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins**:
   - Since the question is about showing funds by name, and the `SERIES_NAME` is in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, we do not need to join with other tables to get this information.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**:
   - The query does not require any complex operations like intersections, unions, or subqueries to filter or combine data from multiple sources. It is a straightforward filter operation.

Based on this analysis, the query does not require joins or nested queries. It is a simple query that filters data based on a condition in a single table. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The schema information suggests that the 'securities_lending' table is relevant.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. The foreign key relationship indicates a possible join with the 'fund_reported_holding' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to identify the column that specifies the fund name or type. The query asks for 'Fidelity' funds, so we need a column that can be filtered by this criterion.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter the results to only include funds associated with 'Fidelity'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, ensure the query is simple and efficient, as the complexity level is 'EASY'. A straightforward SELECT with a WHERE clause should suffice.", helpful=True)]
