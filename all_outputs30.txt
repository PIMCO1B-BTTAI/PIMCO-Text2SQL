Schema Links for Question: List all funds with 'Bond' in their name
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The query "List all funds with 'Bond' in their name" involves searching for funds with 'Bond' in their name. Based on the relevant schema links provided, the table "registrant" contains the column "registrant_name," which likely holds the fund names. 

1. **Tables Involved**: The query primarily involves the "registrant" table to access the "registrant_name" column.

2. **JOIN Requirement**: There is no indication that a JOIN is necessary for this query, as the information needed (fund names) is contained within a single table ("registrant").

3. **Nested Query Requirement**: The query does not require any nested operations such as INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. It is a straightforward search for a substring within a column.

Given these points, the query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
