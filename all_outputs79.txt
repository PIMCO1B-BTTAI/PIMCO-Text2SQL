classification reasoning: To determine the percentage of funds in each quarter with total assets over $1 billion, we need to analyze data from the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, which contains the "TOTAL_ASSETS" and "QUARTER" columns. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The primary table needed is "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" because it contains both the "TOTAL_ASSETS" and "QUARTER" columns.

2. **Filter and Aggregate Data**:
   - We need to filter records where "TOTAL_ASSETS" exceed $1 billion.
   - We then need to calculate the percentage of such records for each quarter.

3. **SQL Query Structure**:
   - We will use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the data by "QUARTER".
   - We will use aggregate functions to count the total number of funds and the number of funds with assets over $1 billion for each quarter.
   - Finally, we will calculate the percentage.

4. **Classification**:
   - This query involves aggregation and grouping but does not require joining multiple tables or using nested queries.
   - Therefore, it is classified as "NON-NESTED".

In summary, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves aggregation and grouping without the need for joins or nested queries.

process_thesql: To answer the question "What percentage of funds in each quarter have total assets over $1 billion?", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Table and Columns**: The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains the `TOTAL_ASSETS` and `QUARTER` columns, which are essential for this query.

2. **Filter Funds with Total Assets Over $1 Billion**: We need to filter the records where `TOTAL_ASSETS` is greater than $1 billion. Since `TOTAL_ASSETS` is stored as text, we will need to cast it to a numeric type for comparison.

3. **Group by Quarter**: We need to group the results by the `QUARTER` column to calculate the percentage for each quarter.

4. **Calculate the Percentage**: For each quarter, calculate the percentage of funds with total assets over $1 billion. This involves counting the total number of funds and the number of funds with assets over $1 billion, then computing the percentage.

5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Use the above logic to construct the SQL query.

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
WITH LargeFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        COUNT(*) as Total_Funds,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT) > 1000000000 THEN 1 END) as Billion_Plus_Funds
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        TOTAL_ASSETS IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        QUARTER
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    Billion_Plus_Funds,
    Total_Funds,
    (Billion_Plus_Funds * 100.0 / Total_Funds) as Large_Fund_Percentage
FROM 
    LargeFunds
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression) `LargeFunds`**: This CTE calculates the total number of funds and the number of funds with assets over $1 billion for each quarter.
- **Main Query**: The main query selects the quarter, the number of funds with assets over $1 billion, the total number of funds, and calculates the percentage of large funds for each quarter.
- **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `QUARTER` in descending order to show the most recent data first.
