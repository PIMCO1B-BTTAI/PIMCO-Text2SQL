classification reasoning: To determine which securities are most actively lent out, we need to analyze data related to securities lending. The relevant information is likely found in the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table, which contains details about whether a security is loaned by the fund. However, to identify specific securities, we also need to reference the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, which provides details about each holding, including the security's identifier.

The query will involve joining these two tables to match holdings with their lending status. Since this requires a join between "SECURITIES_LENDING" and "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" based on the "HOLDING_ID", it is classified as a "NON-NESTED" query. This is because it involves a straightforward join without the need for nested queries.

process_thesql: To determine which securities are most actively lent out, we need to focus on the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table, which contains information about securities lending activities. Specifically, we are interested in identifying securities that are frequently involved in lending transactions.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - The `SECURITIES_LENDING` table contains information about whether a security is involved in lending (`IS_LOAN_BY_FUND`).
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains details about each holding, including the `HOLDING_ID`, which can be linked to the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table.

2. **Join Tables**:
   - We need to join the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table using the `HOLDING_ID` to get details about the securities.

3. **Filter and Aggregate Data**:
   - Filter for securities that are actively lent out (`IS_LOAN_BY_FUND = 'Y'`).
   - Count the number of times each security is involved in lending transactions to determine which are most actively lent out.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - Use a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate the data by security and count the lending occurrences.

Here is the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH ActiveLending AS (
    SELECT 
        H.ISSUER_NAME,
        COUNT(*) as Lending_Count
    FROM 
        SECURITIES_LENDING SL
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING H ON SL.HOLDING_ID = H.HOLDING_ID
    WHERE 
        SL.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND = 'Y'
    GROUP BY 
        H.ISSUER_NAME
)
SELECT 
    ISSUER_NAME,
    Lending_Count
FROM 
    ActiveLending
ORDER BY 
    Lending_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will provide a list of the top 10 securities that are most actively lent out, based on the number of lending transactions they are involved in.
