classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show funds with liabilities exceeding 90% of the largest liability among all funds," we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the relevant tables and columns**: We need to use the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to access the `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` column, which contains the liabilities of the funds.

2. **Determine the largest liability**: We need to find the maximum value of `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` across all funds. This requires an aggregate function (`MAX`) to calculate the largest liability.

3. **Filter funds based on the condition**: We need to filter the funds whose liabilities exceed 90% of the largest liability. This involves comparing each fund's `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` to 90% of the maximum liability found in the previous step.

4. **Decide on the query type**: Since we need to calculate the maximum liability and then use it to filter the funds, this requires a nested query. The inner query will calculate the maximum liability, and the outer query will filter the funds based on the condition.

Given these steps, the SQL query will involve a nested query to first find the maximum liability and then filter the funds based on the calculated threshold. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."
