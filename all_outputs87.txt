classification reasoning: To determine which securities are most actively lent out, we need to analyze data related to securities lending. The relevant tables for this information are likely to be "SECURITIES_LENDING" and possibly "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" to identify specific securities.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - "SECURITIES_LENDING" contains information about securities lending, including whether securities are lent by the fund.
   - "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" provides details about the holdings, including identifiers and descriptions of securities.

2. **Determine Necessary Joins**:
   - We need to join "SECURITIES_LENDING" with "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" to get detailed information about the securities that are being lent out.

3. **Consider the Query Type**:
   - The query requires joining two tables to get comprehensive information about the securities being lent out. This involves using a JOIN operation.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since the query requires a JOIN but does not involve nested queries (like subqueries or set operations such as INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT frh.ISSUER_NAME, COUNT(sl.HOLDING_ID) AS lending_count
FROM SECURITIES_LENDING sl
JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING frh ON sl.HOLDING_ID = frh.HOLDING_ID
GROUP BY frh.ISSUER_NAME
ORDER BY lending_count DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of securities, identified by their issuer names, along with the count of how many times they have been lent out, ordered by the most actively lent securities.
