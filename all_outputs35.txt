Schema Links for Question: Which funds have 'ETF' in their name?
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have 'ETF' in their name?" requires us to identify funds based on their names. The relevant table for this query is likely the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, which contains the "SERIES_NAME" column that would include the fund names.

1. **Identify the Table**: The "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table is the most relevant because it contains the "SERIES_NAME" column, which likely holds the fund names.

2. **Filter Condition**: We need to filter the "SERIES_NAME" column to find entries that contain the substring 'ETF'.

3. **No JOIN Required**: Since the information needed is contained within a single table ("FUND_REPORTED_INFO"), there is no need to join with other tables.

4. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. It is a straightforward filter operation.

Given these points, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a simple selection and filtering operation on a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.
