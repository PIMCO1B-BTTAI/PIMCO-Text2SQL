{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'registrant.registrant_name'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with their registrant names" involves data from two tables: "registrant" for registrant names and "fund_reported_info" for fund details. To list funds with their corresponding registrant names, we need to join these two tables based on a common key, which is the "ACCESSION_NUMBER." This requires a JOIN operation, but it doesn't require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: **
- `SELECT F.SERIES_NAME, R.REGISTRANT_NAME`: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the fund names (`SERIES_NAME`) and the registrant names (`REGISTRANT_NAME`).
- `FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO F`: This specifies that we are selecting data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, aliased as `F`.
- `JOIN REGISTRANT R ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = R.ACCESSION_NUMBER`: This performs an inner join between the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table and the `REGISTRANT` table on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column, ensuring that we only get records where there is a match in both tables. The `REGISTRANT` table is aliased as `R`.

This query will return a list of all funds along with their corresponding registrant names.
