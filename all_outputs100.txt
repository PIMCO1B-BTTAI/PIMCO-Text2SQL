classification reasoning: The question "What's the geographic distribution of our international holdings?" requires us to analyze the geographic distribution of holdings, which involves examining the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table for information about holdings and potentially other related tables to determine geographic distribution.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING," which contains information about holdings, including the "INVESTMENT_COUNTRY" column that can be used to determine geographic distribution.

2. **Joins Needed**: To get a comprehensive view of the geographic distribution, we might need to join with other tables that provide additional context or details about the holdings. However, the primary focus is on the "INVESTMENT_COUNTRY" column in the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table.

3. **Nested Queries**: The question does not inherently require nested queries, as it is primarily about aggregating or grouping data based on the "INVESTMENT_COUNTRY" column.

Given that the task involves analyzing data from a single table and potentially joining with others for additional context, but does not require nested queries, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the geographic distribution of international holdings, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which contains information about each holding, including the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column. This column will help us identify the geographic distribution of the holdings.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` and `HOLDING_ID` from the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table. The `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column will give us the geographic location of each holding.

2. **Filter for International Holdings**: We should filter out holdings that are not based in the US to focus on international holdings. This can be done by excluding 'US' from the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column.

3. **Aggregate Data**: We will count the number of holdings for each country to understand the distribution.

4. **SQL Query Construction**: We will construct a SQL query that selects the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` and counts the number of holdings for each country, excluding the US.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    INVESTMENT_COUNTRY,
    COUNT(HOLDING_ID) AS Number_of_Holdings
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING
WHERE 
    INVESTMENT_COUNTRY IS NOT NULL
    AND INVESTMENT_COUNTRY != 'US'
GROUP BY 
    INVESTMENT_COUNTRY
ORDER BY 
    Number_of_Holdings DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of countries with the number of holdings in each, excluding the US, thus giving us the geographic distribution of international holdings.
