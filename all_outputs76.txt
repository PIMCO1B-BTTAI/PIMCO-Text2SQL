classification reasoning: To answer the question "Which funds reported the highest borrowing within one year?", we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The key information required is the borrowing amount within one year, which is found in the `fund_reported_info` table under the column `borrowing_pay_within_1yr`. We also need to identify the funds, which can be done using the `series_name` or `series_id` from the same table.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Table**: The `fund_reported_info` table contains the `borrowing_pay_within_1yr` column, which is necessary to determine the borrowing amount.

2. **Select the Relevant Columns**: We need to select the `series_name` or `series_id` to identify the fund and `borrowing_pay_within_1yr` to find the borrowing amount.

3. **Order and Limit the Results**: To find the funds with the highest borrowing, we need to order the results by `borrowing_pay_within_1yr` in descending order and possibly limit the results to the top entries.

4. **No Joins or Nested Queries Required**: Since all the necessary information is contained within the `fund_reported_info` table, there is no need for joins or nested queries.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection and ordering operation on a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.
