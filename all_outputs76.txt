classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "How has the geographic distribution of investments changed quarterly?", we need to consider the tables and relationships involved:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table for the `investment_country` and the `REGISTRANT` table for the `quarter`. 

2. **Joins Required**: Since the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, and the `REGISTRANT` table is also linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, we will need to perform joins to connect these tables and gather the necessary data.

3. **Nested Queries**: The query does not explicitly require nested queries (such as using `INTERSECT`, `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, `IN`, `NOT IN`) to achieve the desired result. The main task is to aggregate and compare data across different quarters, which can be done using joins and group by operations.

Given that the query requires joining multiple tables but does not require nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

process_thesql: To address the query "How has the geographic distribution of investments changed quarterly?", we need to analyze the geographic distribution of investments over different quarters. This involves examining the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which contains information about the investment country and the quarter. We will also need to join this table with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to ensure we have the correct context for each holding.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: This table contains the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY`, `HOLDING_ID`, and `QUARTER`.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: This table can be used to join with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to ensure we have the correct context for each holding.

2. **Join Tables**:
   - We will join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` foreign key relationship to ensure we have the correct context for each holding.

3. **Aggregate Data**:
   - We will group the data by `QUARTER` and `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` to see how the distribution changes over time.
   - We will count the number of holdings and sum the investment values for each country and quarter.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - We will select the `QUARTER`, `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY`, the count of holdings, and the total investment value for each group.

Here is the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH GeographicDistribution AS (
    SELECT 
        h.QUARTER,
        h.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY,
        h.HOLDING_ID,
        CAST(h.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT) as Investment_Value,
        f.SERIES_NAME
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING h
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO f ON h.ACCESSION_NUMBER = f.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        h.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    INVESTMENT_COUNTRY,
    COUNT(*) as Number_of_Holdings,
    SUM(Investment_Value) as Total_Investment_Value,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_NAME) as Number_of_Investing_Funds
FROM 
    GeographicDistribution
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER,
    INVESTMENT_COUNTRY
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC,
    Total_Investment_Value DESC;
```

This query will provide a quarterly breakdown of the geographic distribution of investments, showing the number of holdings, total investment value, and the number of distinct funds investing in each country.
