Schema Links for Question: What's the average coupon rate for investment-grade vs high-yield bonds?
{'table_columns': ['debt_security.coupon_type', 'interest_rate_risk.interest_rate_risk_id'], 'primary_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the average coupon rate for investment-grade versus high-yield bonds, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The `DEBT_SECURITY` table contains information about debt securities, including the `COUPON_TYPE` and `ANNUALIZED_RATE`, which are relevant for calculating the average coupon rate.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table might be needed to identify the type of bond (investment-grade or high-yield) based on the `ASSET_CAT` or other relevant columns.

2. **Joins Required**:
   - We need to join `DEBT_SECURITY` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to access the bond classification (investment-grade or high-yield) and the coupon rate.

3. **Classification**:
   - Since we need to join two tables (`DEBT_SECURITY` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`) to get the necessary information, this query requires a JOIN.
   - The query does not require nested queries (like using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN) as we are simply aggregating data across joined tables.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT AVG(annualized_rate) AS average_coupon_rate
FROM debt_security;
```

This query calculates the average coupon rate for all bonds in the `debt_security` table. If there were a way to distinguish between investment-grade and high-yield bonds in the schema, we would include additional filtering criteria in the `WHERE` clause.
