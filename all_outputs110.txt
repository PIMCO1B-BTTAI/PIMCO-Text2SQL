================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "What's the average coupon rate for investment-grade vs high-yield bonds?", we need to consider the tables and relationships involved:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The `debt_security` table is needed for the `coupon_type`.
   - The `interest_rate_risk` table might be relevant if it provides information on the bond's risk category (investment-grade vs high-yield).

2. **Joins**:
   - We need to join `debt_security` with `fund_reported_holding` using the `HOLDING_ID` to access the relevant bond information.
   - If `interest_rate_risk` is used to determine the bond category, it would require joining with `fund_reported_info` using `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Nested Queries**:
   - If the bond category (investment-grade vs high-yield) is determined by a specific condition or requires aggregation, a nested query might be necessary. However, if the category is directly available in one of the tables, a nested query might not be needed.

Given these considerations, the query likely requires joining multiple tables to gather all necessary information. However, without explicit conditions that necessitate a nested query (like filtering based on aggregated results), it seems that the query can be executed with joins alone.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves joins but does not necessarily require nested queries.

            ELSE 'High-Yield'
        END AS Bond_Category

    JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        DS.ANNUALIZED_RATE IS NOT NULL
        AND (F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST IS NOT NULL OR F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL)
)
SELECT 
    Bond_Category,
    AVG(CAST(ANNUALIZED_RATE AS FLOAT)) AS Avg_Coupon_Rate
FROM 
    BondCategories
GROUP BY 
    Bond_Category;
```

This query categorizes bonds into investment-grade and high-yield based on their credit spreads and calculates the average coupon rate for each category.
