classification reasoning: The query "Identify funds with monthly sales flows larger than any ETF" involves comparing sales flows of funds with those of ETFs. This requires:

1. Accessing the "fund_reported_info" table to get the sales flows of funds.
2. Identifying ETFs, which might involve checking a specific category or identifier for ETFs within the data.
3. Comparing the sales flows of funds against those of ETFs.

Since this involves comparing values across potentially different categories or identifiers, it likely requires a nested query to ensure that the sales flows of funds are larger than any ETF. This comparison across different sets of data typically necessitates a nested query structure.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'sales_flow_mon1' column, which represents the monthly sales flows for funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to identify ETFs. The schema does not explicitly mention ETFs, so we assume that ETFs are a subset of funds and their sales flows can be found in the same 'fund_reported_info' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='To find funds with sales flows larger than any ETF, we need a subquery to find the maximum sales flow among ETFs. This requires a nested query structure.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We will use a subquery to calculate the maximum 'sales_flow_mon1' for ETFs. The main query will then select funds with 'sales_flow_mon1' greater than this maximum value.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='The final SQL query will use a WHERE clause to filter funds based on the comparison with the maximum ETF sales flow obtained from the subquery.', helpful=True)]
