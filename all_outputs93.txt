classification reasoning: The query "List funds whose cash exceeds the average cash for their registrant" involves comparing the cash of each fund to the average cash of funds under the same registrant. This requires calculating the average cash for each registrant and then comparing each fund's cash to this average. 

To achieve this, we need to:
1. Calculate the average cash for each registrant, which involves grouping by registrant and using an aggregate function.
2. Compare each fund's cash to the calculated average cash for its registrant.

This process involves subqueries or nested queries to first calculate the average cash per registrant and then use this result to filter funds. Therefore, the SQL query requires nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' column, which represents the cash amount for each fund.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to calculate the average cash for each registrant. This requires grouping the data by registrant and calculating the average cash using an aggregate function.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the average cash for each registrant. This will simplify the main query by allowing us to easily compare each fund's cash to the average cash of its registrant.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The main query will then select funds where the cash exceeds the average cash calculated in the CTE. This involves a join between the CTE and the 'fund_reported_info' table on the registrant identifier.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, ensure that the query is structured to return only the funds that meet the criteria, using a WHERE clause to filter the results based on the comparison.', helpful=True)]
