================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the query "Show me funds facing redemption pressure - where outflows exceed inflows consistently," we need to analyze the data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Specifically, we are interested in comparing the redemption flows (outflows) with the sales and reinvestment flows (inflows) over multiple months to determine if outflows consistently exceed inflows.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains columns for sales flows, reinvestment flows, and redemption flows for three months.

2. **Columns Needed**:
   - `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, `SALES_FLOW_MON3`: These columns represent the inflows from sales.
   - `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON1`, `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON2`, `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON3`: These columns represent the inflows from reinvestments.
   - `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON1`, `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON2`, `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON3`: These columns represent the outflows from redemptions.

3. **Logic**: We need to check if the sum of sales and reinvestment flows is less than the redemption flows for each of the three months. This requires comparing the inflows and outflows for each month.

4. **Query Type**: This query involves calculations and comparisons within a single table without the need for joining multiple tables. It does not require nested queries, as we can perform the necessary calculations directly within the query.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves straightforward calculations and comparisons within a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.
