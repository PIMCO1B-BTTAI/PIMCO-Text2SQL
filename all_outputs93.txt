classification reasoning: The query "Show me funds facing redemption pressure - where outflows exceed inflows consistently" involves analyzing the inflow and outflow data for funds. Specifically, it requires comparing redemption flows and sales flows over multiple months to determine if outflows consistently exceed inflows.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains columns like `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, etc., that are necessary for calculating inflows and outflows.

2. **Conditions**: The query requires checking if outflows (redemption flows) exceed inflows (sales flows) consistently over the months. This involves comparing multiple columns within the same table.

3. **Joins**: There is no explicit need to join with other tables based on the information provided, as all necessary data for this calculation is within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

4. **Nested Queries**: The query does not require nested queries, as the condition can be checked directly using the columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

Given these points, the query does not require joins or nested queries. Therefore, it can be classified as "EASY".

    AND CAST(REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON2 AS FLOAT) > CAST(SALES_FLOW_MON2 AS FLOAT)
    AND CAST(REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON3 AS FLOAT) > CAST(SALES_FLOW_MON3 AS FLOAT);
```

This query selects funds where the redemption flows exceed sales flows consistently over three months, indicating potential redemption pressure.
