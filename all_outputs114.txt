Schema Links for Question: Track changes in high-yield vs investment-grade allocation
{'table_columns': ['interest_rate_risk.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01'], 'primary_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Track changes in high-yield vs investment-grade allocation," we need to consider the following:

1. **Schema Links and Tables Involved**: 
   - The schema links provided include `interest_rate_risk.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01`, which suggests that the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table is involved.
   - The foreign key relationship `INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER` indicates that we may need to join the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get comprehensive data.

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - To track changes in high-yield vs investment-grade allocation, we need to identify which columns or tables provide information about the credit quality of investments (high-yield vs investment-grade).
   - This might involve looking at credit spread columns in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, such as `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_NONINVEST`, etc., which differentiate between investment-grade and non-investment-grade (high-yield) securities.

3. **Query Complexity**:
   - Since we need to compare or track changes over time, this might involve calculating differences or trends, which could require aggregating data or using window functions.
   - The need to join tables (`INTEREST_RATE_RISK` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`) suggests that a simple query on a single table is insufficient.

4. **Classification**:
   - The query requires joining multiple tables to gather all necessary data, which means it is not "EASY."
   - If the query involves complex calculations or comparisons over time, it might require nested queries or subqueries to handle these operations, which would classify it as "NESTED."
   - If the query can be handled with straightforward joins and aggregations without the need for subqueries, it would be "NON-NESTED."

Given these considerations, the task likely involves joining tables and potentially complex operations to track changes, suggesting it could be classified as "NESTED" if it requires subqueries for calculations. However, if straightforward joins and aggregations suffice, it would be "NON-NESTED." Without specific details on the operations needed, a conservative classification would be "NON-NESTED" due to the join requirement.

```

This query retrieves interest rate change data for both high-yield and investment-grade allocations, assuming they are tracked in USD and EUR. It joins the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to ensure the data is linked to the correct fund reports. The results are ordered by accession number and currency code.
