Schema Links for Question: Track changes in high-yield vs investment-grade allocation
{'table_columns': ['interest_rate_risk.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01'], 'primary_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Track changes in high-yield vs investment-grade allocation" involves analyzing data related to interest rate risk, which is likely stored in the "interest_rate_risk" table. However, to differentiate between high-yield and investment-grade allocations, we might need to join with other tables that provide information on the type of securities or their ratings, such as "fund_reported_holding" or "fund_reported_info."

Given the relevant schema links, we have:
- `interest_rate_risk.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01` from the "interest_rate_risk" table.
- The primary keys for "interest_rate_risk" are `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID`.
- A foreign key relationship exists between "interest_rate_risk" and "fund_reported_info" through `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

To track changes in allocation, we would likely need to join "interest_rate_risk" with "fund_reported_info" or another table that provides details on the type of securities (high-yield vs investment-grade). This requires a JOIN operation.

Since the query involves a JOIN but does not necessarily require nested queries (unless further specified conditions or aggregations are needed), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To track changes in high-yield vs investment-grade allocation, we need to focus on the credit spread data available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This table contains columns that differentiate between investment-grade and non-investment-grade (high-yield) credit spreads. Specifically, we can use the `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST` and `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST` columns to analyze the allocation.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify the Relevant Columns**: We need to focus on `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST` and `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Calculate Allocation Ratios**: For each fund, calculate the ratio of investment-grade and high-yield allocations relative to the total assets.

3. **Track Changes Over Time**: Use the `QUARTER` column to track changes in these allocations over different quarters.

4. **Construct the SQL Query**: We will create a query that calculates the average allocation ratios for investment-grade and high-yield bonds for each quarter.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH CreditAllocation AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        SUM(CAST(CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST AS FLOAT)) as Total_Investment_Grade,
        SUM(CAST(CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST AS FLOAT)) as Total_High_Yield,
        SUM(CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT)) as Total_Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST IS NOT NULL
        AND CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        QUARTER
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    (Total_Investment_Grade / NULLIF(Total_Assets, 0)) * 100 as Investment_Grade_Percentage,
    (Total_High_Yield / NULLIF(Total_Assets, 0)) * 100 as High_Yield_Percentage
FROM 
    CreditAllocation
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **CreditAllocation CTE**: This common table expression calculates the total investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads for each quarter, along with the total assets.
- **Final SELECT Statement**: It calculates the percentage of total assets allocated to investment-grade and high-yield bonds for each quarter.
- **NULLIF Function**: Used to prevent division by zero in case `Total_Assets` is zero.

This query will provide a quarterly view of how funds are allocating their assets between high-yield and investment-grade bonds, allowing you to track changes over time.
