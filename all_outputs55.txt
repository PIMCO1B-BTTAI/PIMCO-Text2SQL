Schema Links for Question: Show me the funds with the highest quality fixed income portfolios
{'table_columns': ['nonforeign_exchange_swap.fixed_or_floating_receipt', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Show me the funds with the highest quality fixed income portfolios" requires analyzing the quality of fixed income portfolios, which likely involves multiple tables. The relevant schema links suggest the involvement of tables like "nonforeign_exchange_swap" and "securities_lending," which are connected to "fund_reported_holding" through foreign keys.

To determine the highest quality fixed income portfolios, we would need to join these tables to gather relevant data about the funds' holdings and possibly perform calculations or comparisons to assess quality. This process involves using JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.

Since the query requires joining multiple tables but does not necessarily involve nested queries (like subqueries with INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
