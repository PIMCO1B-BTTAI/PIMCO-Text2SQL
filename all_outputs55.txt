classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me the funds with the highest quality fixed income portfolios," we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Query**: The query is asking for funds with the highest quality fixed income portfolios. This implies we need to evaluate the quality of fixed income holdings within the funds.

2. **Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We need to identify which tables contain information about fixed income portfolios. Typically, this would involve tables like `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and possibly `DEBT_SECURITY` for details on debt securities.
   - We might need to look at columns that indicate the quality of the fixed income securities, such as credit ratings or other indicators of quality.

3. **Joins and Relationships**:
   - To get information about the funds and their holdings, we will likely need to join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to get fund-level details.
   - If we need specific details about the debt securities, we might also need to join with `DEBT_SECURITY`.

4. **Complexity**:
   - If the query requires aggregating or ranking funds based on the quality of their fixed income portfolios, it might involve more complex operations.
   - However, if it simply involves joining tables to get the necessary information, it would be classified as NON-NESTED.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the query likely involves joining multiple tables to assess the quality of fixed income portfolios, but does not necessarily require nested queries (like subqueries or set operations), it would be classified as NON-NESTED.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER, COUNT(ds.HOLDING_ID) AS high_quality_count
FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING frh
JOIN DEBT_SECURITY ds ON frh.HOLDING_ID = ds.HOLDING_ID
WHERE ds.IS_DEFAULT = 'N' AND ds.COUPON_TYPE = 'fixed'
GROUP BY frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER
ORDER BY high_quality_count DESC;
```

This query identifies funds with the highest number of high-quality fixed income securities by counting non-defaulted, fixed coupon debt securities within each fund's portfolio.

final_output: 
SELECT frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER, COUNT(ds.HOLDING_ID) AS high_quality_count
FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING frh
