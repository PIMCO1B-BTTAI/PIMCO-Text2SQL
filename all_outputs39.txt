classification reasoning: To determine the complexity of the SQL query needed to answer the question "Show me all Fidelity funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: We need to find tables that might contain information about funds and their names. The most relevant table for this would likely be `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains information about funds, including the `SERIES_NAME`.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since the question is asking for "Fidelity funds," we need to check if the `SERIES_NAME` or any other relevant column contains the name "Fidelity." This can be done by filtering the `SERIES_NAME` column for entries that include "Fidelity."

3. **Assess the Need for Nested Queries**: The question does not require any complex conditions that would necessitate nested queries, such as subqueries or set operations (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT).

4. **Conclusion**: Since the query involves a simple filter on a single table without the need for JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To answer the question "Show me all Fidelity funds," we need to identify the table and column that contain information about the fund names. Based on the provided schema, the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains a column named `SERIES_NAME`, which likely holds the names of the funds. We are looking for funds associated with "Fidelity," so we will filter the `SERIES_NAME` column for entries that contain the word "Fidelity."

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT SERIES_NAME
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE SERIES_NAME LIKE '%Fidelity%';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT SERIES_NAME**: We are selecting the `SERIES_NAME` column because it contains the names of the funds.

2. **FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO**: This is the table that contains information about the funds, including their names.

3. **WHERE SERIES_NAME LIKE '%Fidelity%'**: We use the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `%Fidelity%` to filter fund names that contain the word "Fidelity" anywhere in the name. The `%` wildcard allows for any characters before or after "Fidelity," ensuring we capture all relevant entries. 

This query will return all fund names from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table that include "Fidelity" in their series name.
