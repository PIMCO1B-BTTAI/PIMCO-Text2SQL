classification reasoning: To answer the question "What percentage of bonds have missed interest payments by sector?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We need information about bonds, specifically those that have missed interest payments. This information is likely in the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, which contains the column `ARE_ANY_INTEREST_PAYMENT` indicating missed payments.
   - We also need to categorize these bonds by sector. The sector information might be found in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which includes columns like `ASSET_CAT` or `ISSUER_TYPE` that could represent sectors.

2. **Determine Necessary Joins**:
   - We need to join `DEBT_SECURITY` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to associate each bond with its sector. This requires a join on the `HOLDING_ID` key, which is a foreign key relationship between these tables.

3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - For each sector, calculate the percentage of bonds that have missed interest payments. This involves counting the total number of bonds in each sector and the number of bonds with missed payments, then computing the percentage.

Given these steps, the query will involve joining tables and aggregating data to calculate percentages. This requires a join but not a nested query. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
