================================================================================
classification reasoning: To find funds with unusual monthly return patterns, we need to analyze the monthly return data, which is stored in the "MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN" table. This involves examining the monthly return values to identify potential outliers. 

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN" because it contains the monthly return data.

2. **Analysis Requirement**: Identifying outliers typically involves statistical analysis, such as calculating the mean and standard deviation of returns and then determining which returns fall outside a certain range (e.g., more than two standard deviations from the mean).

3. **SQL Complexity**: This task may require calculating aggregate statistics (like average and standard deviation) and then filtering based on these calculations. While this involves some level of complexity, it does not necessarily require nested queries. Instead, it can be achieved using aggregate functions and conditional logic within a single query.

4. **Join Requirement**: Since the task focuses on analyzing data within a single table ("MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN"), there is no need for joins with other tables.

Given these considerations, the SQL query for this task would primarily involve aggregate functions and conditional logic within the "MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN" table. Therefore, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves more than simple retrieval but does not require nested queries or joins with other tables.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER, MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1, MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2, MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3
FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN
WHERE (MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 > (SELECT AVG(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1) + 2 * STDDEV(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1) FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN)
       OR MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 < (SELECT AVG(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1) - 2 * STDDEV(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1) FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN))
   OR (MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 > (SELECT AVG(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2) + 2 * STDDEV(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2) FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN)
       OR MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 < (SELECT AVG(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2) - 2 * STDDEV(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2) FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN))
   OR (MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 > (SELECT AVG(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3) + 2 * STDDEV(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3) FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN)
       OR MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 < (SELECT AVG(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3) - 2 * STDDEV(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3) FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN));
```

This query identifies funds with monthly returns that are potential outliers by checking if any of the monthly returns are more than 2 standard deviations away from the average return for that month.
