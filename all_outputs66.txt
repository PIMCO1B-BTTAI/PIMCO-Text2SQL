classification reasoning: The query "Find funds with unusual monthly return patterns - looking for potential outliers" involves analyzing data from the "monthly_total_return" table to identify outliers in monthly return patterns. 

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "monthly_total_return" since it contains the monthly return data. 

2. **Joins**: There is a foreign key relationship between "monthly_total_return" and "fund_reported_info" through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER". However, the query does not explicitly require data from "fund_reported_info" or any other table, so a join is not necessary for this specific task.

3. **Nested Queries**: Identifying outliers typically involves statistical analysis, which might require subqueries to calculate averages, standard deviations, or other statistical measures. However, if the task is simply to identify outliers based on predefined criteria (e.g., returns above or below certain thresholds), it might not require nested queries.

Given the information, if the task involves simple threshold-based identification of outliers without complex statistical calculations, it would not require nested queries or joins. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY". However, if more complex statistical analysis is needed, it might lean towards "NESTED". 

For the purpose of this classification, assuming a straightforward approach, the label would be:

Label: "EASY"

process_thesql: To find funds with unusual monthly return patterns, we can analyze the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table for potential outliers in the monthly return values. Here's a SQL query that identifies funds with unusually high or low monthly returns:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.SERIES_NAME,
    M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1,
    M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2,
    M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3
FROM 
    MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN M
    JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F 
        ON M.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE 
    CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) > 10 
    OR CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) < -10
    OR CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) > 10 
    OR CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) < -10
    OR CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT) > 10 
    OR CAST(M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT) < -10;
```

This query selects funds with monthly returns greater than 10% or less than -10% in any of the three months, which could indicate unusual performance. Adjust the threshold values as needed to refine the search for outliers.
