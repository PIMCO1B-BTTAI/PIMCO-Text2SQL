classification reasoning: To determine which investment firms have the most diverse geographic exposure in their holdings, we need to analyze the data from the "fund_reported_holding" table, specifically focusing on the "investment_country" column. This will allow us to assess the diversity of geographic exposure.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "fund_reported_holding" because it contains information about the holdings and their respective countries.

2. **Data Required**: We need to count the number of distinct countries ("investment_country") for each firm. This requires grouping the data by the firm identifier, which is typically the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" in this context.

3. **Join Requirements**: Since we are only interested in the diversity of geographic exposure within the holdings, we do not need to join with other tables unless we want to include additional firm-specific information (e.g., firm name from the "registrant" table).

4. **Query Type**: The query involves aggregating data to count distinct countries for each firm. This can be achieved using a simple aggregation query with a GROUP BY clause. There is no need for nested queries or complex joins.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a JOIN only if additional firm information is needed, but it does not require nested queries. The primary operation is an aggregation to count distinct values.

process_thesql: To determine which investment firms have the most diverse geographic exposure in their holdings, we need to analyze the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which contains information about the holdings of each fund, including the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY`. We will also need to join this table with the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables to get the registrant names and ensure we are analyzing the correct funds.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Identify the Tables and Columns Needed:**
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: We need the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` and `HOLDING_ID`.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: We need the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to join with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`.
   - `REGISTRANT`: We need the `REGISTRANT_NAME` to identify the investment firms.

2. **Join the Tables:**
   - Join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
   - Join the result with `REGISTRANT` using `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the `REGISTRANT_NAME`.

3. **Calculate Geographic Diversity:**
   - Count the distinct `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` for each `REGISTRANT_NAME` to determine the diversity of geographic exposure.
   - Count the total number of holdings for each `REGISTRANT_NAME` to provide context.

4. **Filter and Order the Results:**
   - We can filter out registrants with a low number of total holdings to focus on those with significant exposure.
   - Order the results by the number of distinct countries to find the most geographically diverse firms.

Here is the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH GeographicDiversity AS (
    SELECT 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME,
        COUNT(DISTINCT H.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY) as Country_Count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT H.HOLDING_ID) as Total_Holdings
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F 
            ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING H 
            ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = H.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        H.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME
)
SELECT 
    REGISTRANT_NAME,
    Country_Count,
    Total_Holdings,
    ROUND(CAST(Country_Count AS FLOAT) / CAST(Total_Holdings AS FLOAT) * 100, 2) as Diversity_Score
FROM 
    GeographicDiversity
WHERE 
    Total_Holdings > 10
ORDER BY 
    Country_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
