================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each registrant have?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each registrant. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the tables involved: We need information about registrants and the funds they report. The relevant tables are "REGISTRANT" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO."

2. Determine the relationship: The relationship between these tables is established through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" field, which is a foreign key in "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" and a primary key in "REGISTRANT."

3. Formulate the query: We need to join these tables on "ACCESSION_NUMBER" and then count the number of funds (or series) for each registrant.

Since this requires a JOIN between the "REGISTRANT" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" tables but does not require any nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question involves registrants and funds, so we need to determine how these entities are related in the schema.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we need to count the number of funds per registrant, we will likely need to join tables and use a GROUP BY clause.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to identify the relevant columns for the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses. The registrant name and a count of funds are required.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider the relationships between tables. The schema indicates foreign keys between REGISTRANT and FUND_REPORTED_INFO, and between SECURITIES_LENDING and FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING, which suggests how to join the tables.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, structure the SQL query to include the necessary joins and aggregations to count the funds for each registrant.', helpful=True)]
