classification reasoning: The query "I'm looking for any funds with 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name what's their total AUM?" involves finding funds based on specific keywords in their names and calculating their total assets under management (AUM). 

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - We need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to find the `SERIES_NAME` that contains 'sustainable' or 'ESG'.
   - We also need to access the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column from the same table to calculate the total AUM.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The condition involves filtering the `SERIES_NAME` for the presence of 'sustainable' or 'ESG'.

3. **Joins**:
   - There is no explicit need for a join with another table since all required information is within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

4. **Nested Queries**:
   - There is no need for nested queries as the filtering and aggregation can be done directly on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

Given these points, the query does not require any joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
