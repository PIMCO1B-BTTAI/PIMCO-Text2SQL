classification reasoning: To answer the question "I'm looking for any funds with 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name what's their total AUM?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: We need information about the fund names and their total assets under management (AUM). This information is likely contained in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which includes columns like `SERIES_NAME` (for the fund name) and `TOTAL_ASSETS` (for the AUM).

2. **Conditions**: We need to filter the funds based on their names containing the keywords 'sustainable' or 'ESG'. This can be done using a `LIKE` clause in SQL.

3. **No Joins Required**: Since all the necessary information (fund name and total assets) is available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, we do not need to join with any other tables.

4. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like subqueries or set operations (INTERSECT, UNION, etc.).

Given these points, the SQL query can be constructed using a simple `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the fund names. Therefore, the query does not require any joins or nested queries, and it can be classified as "EASY".
