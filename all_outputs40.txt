================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each registrant have?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each registrant. This involves data from two tables: "registrant" and "fund_reported_info." We need to join these tables based on the common "ACCESSION_NUMBER" to associate funds with their respective registrants. After joining, we can group the results by registrant and count the number of funds for each. This requires a JOIN operation but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question involves registrants and funds, so we need to consider the 'registrant' and 'securities_lending' tables.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we need to count the number of funds per registrant, we will need to join the tables based on the foreign key relationships provided.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to use a GROUP BY clause to aggregate the data by registrant. This will allow us to count the number of funds associated with each registrant.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The SELECT clause should include the registrant name and the count of funds. This will provide the desired output of how many funds each registrant has.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider the WHERE clause. In this case, no specific filtering is required beyond the necessary joins, as we want to count all funds for each registrant.', helpful=True)]
