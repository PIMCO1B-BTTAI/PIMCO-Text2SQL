================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "How do PIMCO's bond funds compare to their equity funds in terms of growth?", we need to consider several aspects:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: We need to identify which funds belong to PIMCO. This information can be found in the `REGISTRANT` table, where we can filter by `REGISTRANT_NAME` to find entries related to PIMCO.

2. **Differentiate Between Bond and Equity Funds**: We need to categorize the funds into bond and equity funds. This categorization can be done using the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which categorizes the asset type of the holding.

3. **Measure Growth**: To compare growth, we need to look at metrics that indicate growth over time. The `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table provides monthly total returns, which can be used to assess growth.

4. **Join Tables**: We need to join the `REGISTRANT`, `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` tables to get a comprehensive view of PIMCO's funds, their categories, and their growth metrics.

5. **Comparison**: Finally, we need to compare the growth metrics of bond funds versus equity funds.

Given these steps, the query will involve multiple tables and require joining them based on foreign keys. It will also involve filtering and aggregating data to compare growth metrics. Therefore, this query requires JOIN operations but does not necessarily require nested queries. Thus, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

This query calculates the average total return for PIMCO's bond and equity funds over the reporting period and compares them. Adjust the `ASSET_CAT` filter as needed to match the specific categories used in your dataset.
