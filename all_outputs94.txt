================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show states with above-average registrant counts" involves calculating the average number of registrants per state and then comparing each state's count to this average. This requires aggregating data to count registrants per state and then using a nested query to filter states with counts above the average. Therefore, the query involves a nested query to perform the comparison with the average. So, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required, which is the 'registrant' table, as it contains the 'state' and 'registrant_name' columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to calculate the average number of registrants per state, which requires aggregation using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="To find states with above-average registrant counts, we need to compare each state's count to the overall average, which suggests using a nested query or CTE to first calculate the average.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='A Common Table Expression (CTE) is useful here to first calculate the average registrant count across all states, making the main query cleaner and more readable.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The main query will then select states where the count of registrants is greater than the average calculated in the CTE.', helpful=True)]
