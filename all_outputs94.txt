classification reasoning: The question "How do PIMCO's bond funds compare to their equity funds in terms of growth?" requires analyzing and comparing data related to PIMCO's bond and equity funds. This involves multiple steps:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: We need to filter the data to only include funds associated with PIMCO. This likely involves using the `REGISTRANT` table to identify PIMCO's CIK or name.

2. **Differentiate Between Bond and Equity Funds**: We need to distinguish between bond and equity funds. This might involve examining the `ASSET_CAT` or similar columns in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` or related tables.

3. **Measure Growth**: To compare growth, we might need to look at columns related to financial performance over time, such as `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` or other relevant metrics.

4. **Join and Aggregate Data**: This will likely require joining multiple tables to gather all necessary information, such as `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN`, and possibly others.

5. **Comparison**: Finally, we need to compare the growth metrics between bond and equity funds.

Given these steps, the query will involve multiple joins across different tables and potentially some aggregation or calculation to measure growth. It does not necessarily require nested queries but does require joining multiple tables to gather and compare the necessary data.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To compare PIMCO's bond funds to their equity funds in terms of growth, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify PIMCO Funds**: We need to filter the funds managed by PIMCO. This can be done by checking the `REGISTRANT_NAME` in the `REGISTRANT` table.

2. **Categorize Funds**: We need to categorize the funds into bond funds and equity funds. This can be done by checking the `SERIES_NAME` in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for keywords like 'BOND' and 'EQUITY'.

3. **Calculate Growth**: We need to calculate the growth of these funds. This can be done by looking at the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table to get the returns over a period of time.

4. **Join Tables**: We will need to join the `REGISTRANT`, `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` tables to get the necessary data.

5. **Aggregate and Compare**: Finally, we will aggregate the data to compare the average growth of bond funds versus equity funds.

Here's how the SQL query might look:

```sql
WITH PIMCOFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        F.SERIES_ID,
        CASE 
            WHEN F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%BOND%' THEN 'Bond'
            WHEN F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%EQUITY%' THEN 'Equity'
        END as Fund_Type,
        M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1,
        M.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2,

        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F 
            ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
        JOIN MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN M 
            ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = M.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
        AND (F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%BOND%' OR F.SERIES_NAME LIKE '%EQUITY%')

    SELECT 
        Fund_Type,
        AVG((CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) + 
             CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) + 
             CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT)) / 3) as Avg_Growth
    FROM 
        PIMCOFunds

        Fund_Type

SELECT 
    Fund_Type,
    Avg_Growth

### Explanation:
- **PIMCOFunds CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) filters funds managed by PIMCO and categorizes them into bond and equity funds based on their `SERIES_NAME`. It also retrieves the monthly returns for these funds.
- **FundGrowth CTE**: This CTE calculates
