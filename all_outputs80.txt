classification reasoning: The query requires calculating the average fund count and then filtering registrants based on whether their fund count is above this average. This involves aggregating data to count funds per registrant and then comparing these counts to the average, which typically requires a nested query to first calculate the average and then filter based on it. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table is essential as it contains the registrant names, and the 'securities_lending' table is needed to count the funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to aggregate the data to count the number of funds per registrant, which suggests using a GROUP BY clause.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to calculate the average fund count to exclude registrants with below-average counts. This requires a subquery or CTE to compute the average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='To find the top 5 registrants, we will need to order the results by fund count in descending order and limit the results to 5.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause to exclude below-average counts. This involves comparing each registrant's fund count to the calculated average.", helpful=True)]
