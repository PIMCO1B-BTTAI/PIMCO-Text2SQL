classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Which funds have zero liabilities?" needs to check the "total_liabilities" column in the "fund_reported_info" table. Since we are only querying a single table and there is no need for JOINs or nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name" needs to access the "fund_reported_info" table to find funds with 'Growth' in their series name. This can be done using a simple query with a WHERE clause to filter the series names containing 'Growth'. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY".

classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Index' in their name" needs to identify funds with 'Index' in their name. This information can be found in the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically in the "series_name" column.

classification reasoning: To answer the question "Which funds have assets between 100M and 500M?", we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The table "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" contains information about the funds, including their total assets. We need to filter the funds based on the "TOTAL_ASSETS" column to find those with assets between 100 million and 500 million.

Since the question only involves filtering data from a single table ("FUND_REPORTED_INFO") based on a condition, there is no need for a JOIN or a nested query. We can directly query the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to get the desired results.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it does not require JOINs or nested queries.

classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have assets between 100M and 500M?" requires us to identify funds based on their asset values. The relevant table for this query is "FUND_REPORTED_INFO," which contains the "TOTAL_ASSETS" column. 

To answer this question, we need to filter the records in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table where the "TOTAL_ASSETS" value is between 100 million and 500 million. This operation involves a simple filtering condition on a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query for this question can be classified as "EASY."
