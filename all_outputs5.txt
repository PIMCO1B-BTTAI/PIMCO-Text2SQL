================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Which funds have zero liabilities?" needs to check the "total_liabilities" column in the "fund_reported_info" table. Since we are only querying a single table and there is no need for JOINs or nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question asks about funds and their liabilities, so the 'fund_reported_info' table is relevant as it contains 'total_liabilities'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are only interested in funds with zero liabilities, we do not need to join with other tables or perform aggregations.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter the records where 'total_liabilities' is zero.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Check if any additional filtering or grouping is required. In this case, no additional filtering or grouping is needed as we are directly querying for zero liabilities.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, ensure the query is simple and efficient. Since we are only selecting funds with zero liabilities, a straightforward SELECT statement with a WHERE clause is sufficient.', helpful=True)]

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name" needs to access the "fund_reported_info" table to find funds with 'Growth' in their series name. This can be done using a simple query with a WHERE clause to filter the series names containing 'Growth'. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY". 

Label: "EASY"

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="The question asks for funds with 'Growth' in their name, so we need to identify the table that contains fund names.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the schema information provided does not explicitly mention a table with fund names, we need to infer that the relevant table might be missing or not fully described.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Given the lack of explicit table information for fund names, we will assume a hypothetical table named 'funds' with a column 'fund_name' for the purpose of this query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The WHERE clause will be used to filter fund names containing the word 'Growth'.

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Index' in their name" needs to identify funds with 'Index' in their name. This information can be found in the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically in the "series_name" column. Since the query only involves filtering data from a single table without requiring any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification: "EASY"
================================================================================
Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query. The table 'fund_var_info' contains the column 'designated_index_name', which seems to be the most relevant for finding funds with 'Index' in their name.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins or additional tables are necessary. Since the question only asks for funds with 'Index' in their name, and the relevant column is in 'fund_var_info', no joins are needed.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should focus on constructing the WHERE clause to filter the results. We need to use a condition that checks if 'designated_index_name' contains the word 'Index'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and does not require any aggregations or complex conditions, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause will suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, ensure that the SQL query is properly formatted and syntactically correct to return the desired results.', helpful=True)]
