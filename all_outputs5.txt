Schema Links for Question: List all funds with their registrant names
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "List all funds with their registrant names," we need to retrieve data from two tables: "REGISTRANT" for the registrant names and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" for the fund details. The relationship between these tables is established through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" foreign key, which links "REGISTRANT" to "FUND_REPORTED_INFO."

Since we need to combine data from these two tables, a JOIN operation is necessary. However, the query does not require any nested queries, as we are simply retrieving and combining data from the two tables based on their relationship.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a JOIN but does not involve nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT registrant.registrant_name, fund_reported_info.series_name
FROM registrant
JOIN fund_reported_info ON registrant.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number;
```

This query will list all funds with their registrant names by joining the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

final_output: 
SELECT registrant.registrant_name, fund_reported_info.series_name
FROM registrant
JOIN fund_reported_info ON registrant.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number

Result: True
