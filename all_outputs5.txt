classification reasoning: The query "List all funds with their registrant names" involves retrieving data from two tables: "registrant" for the registrant names and "fund_reported_info" for the fund details. To achieve this, we need to join these two tables using the foreign key relationship: `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`. This requires a JOIN operation, but it does not require any nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification: "NON-NESTED"

process_thesql: To list all funds with their registrant names, we need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. The `REGISTRANT` table contains the registrant names, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains the fund series names. We can use the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the key to join these tables because it is a common column in both tables and is used as a foreign key.

Here is the step-by-step process to construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify the tables involved**: We need the `REGISTRANT` table for the registrant names and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for the fund series names.

2. **Determine the join condition**: The join condition is `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Select the required columns**: We need to select `REGISTRANT.REGISTRANT_NAME` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.SERIES_NAME`.

4. **Construct the SQL query**: Use a `SELECT` statement with a `JOIN` clause to combine the tables based on the join condition.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    R.REGISTRANT_NAME,
    F.SERIES_NAME
FROM 
    REGISTRANT R
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO F 
ON 
    R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER;
```

This query will list all funds along with their corresponding registrant names by joining the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column.
