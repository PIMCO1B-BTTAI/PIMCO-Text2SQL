classification reasoning: To answer the question "Which funds have assets between 100M and 500M?", we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The table "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" contains information about the funds, including their total assets. We need to filter the funds based on the "TOTAL_ASSETS" column to find those with assets between 100 million and 500 million.

Since this query only involves filtering data from a single table ("FUND_REPORTED_INFO") and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY".

```

### Reasoning:

1. **Schema Understanding**: The task is to find funds with total assets between 100 million and 500 million. The relevant table for this information is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column.

2. **Column Mapping**: The `TOTAL_ASSETS` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table directly corresponds to the "assets" mentioned in the question. The `SERIES_NAME` column provides the name of the fund, which is the desired output.

3. **SQL Query Structure**:
   - **SELECT Clause**: We select `SERIES_NAME` to get the names of the funds.
   - **FROM Clause**: We use the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table because it contains the necessary information about the funds and their total assets.
   - **WHERE Clause**: We apply a condition to filter funds where `TOTAL_ASSETS` is between 100 million and 500 million. This is done using the `BETWEEN` operator for clarity and simplicity.

4. **No Nested Queries or Joins**: The task can be accomplished with a straightforward query without the need for nested queries or joins, as all required data is contained within a single table.
