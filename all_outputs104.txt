Schema Links for Question: Track PIMCO's international exposure trends across quarters
{'table_columns': ['nonforeign_exchange_swap.termination_date', 'registrant.quarter', 'interest_rate_risk.interest_rate_risk_id'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID', 'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the query "Track PIMCO's international exposure trends across quarters," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The query involves tracking trends, which suggests analyzing data over time. This typically involves the `quarter` column.
   - We need to identify PIMCO's exposure, which likely involves the `registrant` table to identify PIMCO and potentially other tables that detail exposure, such as `nonforeign_exchange_swap` for international exposure.

2. **Joins Required**:
   - To connect PIMCO's information with its exposure data, we need to join the `registrant` table with other relevant tables like `nonforeign_exchange_swap`.
   - The foreign key relationships provided indicate that `NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID` is linked to `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID`, which in turn is linked to `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`, and this is linked to `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The query requires joining multiple tables to gather the necessary data, which makes it more complex than a simple query.
   - However, it does not necessarily require nested queries, as the information can be obtained through joins.

Given these considerations, the query involves multiple joins but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To track PIMCO's international exposure trends across quarters, we need to focus on the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables. The `REGISTRANT` table will help us identify PIMCO's funds, and the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table will provide information about the holdings, including their geographic exposure.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: Use the `REGISTRANT` table to filter for PIMCO by its `REGISTRANT_NAME`.

2. **Join with Holdings**: Join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the holdings related to PIMCO.

3. **Filter for International Holdings**: In the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, filter for holdings where the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` is not 'US' to identify international exposure.

4. **Aggregate by Quarter**: Group the results by `QUARTER` to track the trends over time.

5. **Calculate Exposure**: Sum the `CURRENCY_VALUE` of the international holdings to quantify the exposure.

Now, let's construct the SQL query:

```sql
WITH PIMCOInternationalExposure AS (
    SELECT 
        R.QUARTER,
        H.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY,
        SUM(CAST(H.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT)) AS International_Exposure
    FROM 
        REGISTRANT R
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING H ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = H.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
        AND H.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY IS NOT NULL
        AND H.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY != 'US'
    GROUP BY 
        R.QUARTER, H.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    SUM(International_Exposure) AS Total_International_Exposure
FROM 
    PIMCOInternationalExposure
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

This query will provide the total international exposure of PIMCO's funds for each quarter, allowing you to track trends over time.
