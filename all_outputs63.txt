================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the exposure by state and check geographic concentration, we need to analyze data related to the geographic distribution of registrants or funds. This involves examining the "state" information from the "registrant" table. However, to assess exposure, we might also need to consider financial metrics such as total assets or net assets from the "fund_reported_info" table.

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - "registrant" for state information.
   - "fund_reported_info" for financial metrics like total assets.

2. **Join Requirement**: 
   - We need to join "registrant" and "fund_reported_info" on the common key "ACCESSION_NUMBER" to combine geographic and financial data.

3. **Nested Query Requirement**: 
   - The query does not inherently require nested queries. We can achieve the desired result by joining the tables and aggregating data by state.

Given these considerations, the SQL query would involve a join but not a nested query. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table contains the 'state' column, which is crucial for determining geographic exposure.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to measure 'exposure'. Since the schema does not provide explicit financial metrics, we assume 'interest_rate_risk' might be a proxy for exposure.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should join the 'registrant' and 'interest_rate_risk' tables using the 'accession_number' as the foreign key to link them.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause is necessary to aggregate data by state, allowing us to see the concentration of exposure per state.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we will use a COUNT or SUM function to quantify the exposure, depending on the available data in 'interest_rate_risk'.", helpful=True)]
