classification reasoning: To determine the exposure by state and check geographic concentration, we need to analyze data related to the geographic distribution of registrants or holdings. This involves examining the "registrant" table to get the state information and potentially aggregating data to assess exposure.

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "registrant" since it contains state information. We might also need to consider other tables if we want to assess exposure based on financial metrics or holdings, but the question primarily focuses on geographic concentration.

2. **Join Requirements**: If we were to assess exposure based on financial metrics or holdings, we might need to join with tables like "fund_reported_info" to get financial data. However, the question is more about geographic distribution, which can be directly obtained from the "registrant" table.

3. **Nested Queries**: The question does not inherently require nested queries. We are primarily interested in aggregating or summarizing data by state, which can be done using simple aggregation functions.

Given these considerations, the query would likely involve a straightforward aggregation of data by state from the "registrant" table, without the need for joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table contains the 'state' column, which is crucial for determining geographic exposure.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are interested in exposure by state, we need to aggregate data by the 'state' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the SELECT clause. We need to select the 'state' and an aggregation of exposure, which might be represented by a count or sum of a relevant column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Evaluate the need for a GROUP BY clause. Since we are aggregating data by state, a GROUP BY clause on the 'state' column is necessary.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider the WHERE clause. There are no specific conditions mentioned, so we will not include additional filters beyond the necessary joins.', helpful=True)]
