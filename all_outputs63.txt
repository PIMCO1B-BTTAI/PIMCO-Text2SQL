classification reasoning: To determine which fund families are most active in securities lending, we need to analyze data from multiple tables. Specifically, we need to:

1. Identify the fund families, which can be found in the `REGISTRANT` table.
2. Determine their activity in securities lending, which involves the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table.

The relationship between these tables is established through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `HOLDING_ID` keys. We need to join these tables to correlate fund families with their securities lending activities.

Since this query requires joining multiple tables to gather the necessary information, it falls under the "NON-NESTED" category. We don't need nested queries, but we do need to perform joins to combine data from different tables.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT registrant_name, COUNT(*) AS lending_activity_count
FROM securities_lending
JOIN fund_reported_holding ON securities_lending.holding_id = fund_reported_holding.holding_id
JOIN fund_reported_info ON fund_reported_holding.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
JOIN registrant ON fund_reported_info.accession_number = registrant.accession_number
WHERE is_loan_by_fund = 'Y'
GROUP BY registrant_name
ORDER BY lending_activity_count DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of fund families, ordered by the number of securities lending activities they are involved in, showing which are the most active.
