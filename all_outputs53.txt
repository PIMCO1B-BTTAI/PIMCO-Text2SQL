classification reasoning: To address the question "Find me funds that might be too exposed to interest rate changes - check their duration risk," we need to consider the following:

1. **Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question is about interest rate exposure, which suggests looking at the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table. The relevant columns for assessing duration risk would likely include those that measure changes in portfolio value due to interest rate changes, such as `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01`, etc.

2. **Primary and Foreign Keys**: The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table has a primary key of `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID`. It is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` foreign key.

3. **Join Requirement**: To identify specific funds, we might need to join the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get details about the funds, such as their names or identifiers.

4. **Classification**: Since the query involves joining the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to gather comprehensive information about the funds and their exposure to interest rate changes, it requires a JOIN operation. However, it does not require nested queries.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a JOIN but not nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'interest_rate_risk' table is crucial as it contains information about interest rate changes and duration risk.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins are needed. The 'interest_rate_risk' table is linked to the 'fund_reported_info' table via the 'accession_number', which will help us identify the specific funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to focus on the 'intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01' column in the 'interest_rate_risk' table, as it likely represents the duration risk or sensitivity to interest rate changes.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We should filter funds with high duration risk, which might be indicated by a high value in 'intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, determine if a GROUP BY clause is necessary. In this case, it is not needed as we are interested in individual fund exposure rather than aggregated data.', helpful=True)]
