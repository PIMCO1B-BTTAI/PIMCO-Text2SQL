classification reasoning: To address the question "Find me funds that might be too exposed to interest rate changes - check their duration risk," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question is about interest rate exposure, which suggests looking at the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table. This table contains columns like `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01`, etc., which measure the change in value of the portfolio due to interest rate changes.

2. **Determine the Criteria for Exposure**: The question implies identifying funds with high exposure to interest rate changes. This could mean looking for high values in the `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_*` columns, which indicate significant sensitivity to interest rate changes.

3. **Schema Links and Joins**: The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`. To identify specific funds, we might need to join these tables to get fund details.

4. **Classification**:
   - **JOIN Requirement**: Since we need to link `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to get fund details, a JOIN is necessary.
   - **Nested Query Requirement**: The task does not inherently require nested queries like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. We are primarily filtering and joining data.

Given these considerations, the SQL query would require a JOIN but not a nested query. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'interest_rate_risk' table is crucial as it contains information about interest rate changes and duration risk.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins are needed. The 'interest_rate_risk' table is linked to the 'fund_reported_info' table via the 'accession_number', which will help us identify the specific funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to focus on the 'intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01' column in the 'interest_rate_risk' table, as it likely represents the duration risk or sensitivity to interest rate changes.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We should filter funds with high duration risk, which might be indicated by a high 'intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01' value.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, decide if a GROUP BY clause is necessary. In this case, it is not needed as we are interested in individual fund exposure rather than aggregated data.', helpful=True)]
