classification reasoning: The query "Find me funds that might be taking on too much credit risk - look at their non-investment grade holdings" involves analyzing data related to credit risk and non-investment grade holdings. To achieve this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` for details on holdings.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for credit spread information.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We need to identify non-investment grade holdings, which implies filtering based on certain criteria related to credit risk.

3. **Joins**:
   - A join between `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` is necessary to correlate holdings with their credit risk attributes.

4. **Nested Queries**:
   - The query might require nested logic to filter or aggregate data based on specific conditions related to credit risk.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve both joins and potentially nested queries to filter and analyze the data effectively. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To find funds that might be taking on too much credit risk by examining their non-investment grade holdings, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically looking at the non-investment grade credit spreads. We can identify funds with significant exposure to non-investment grade holdings by checking the `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST` column.

Here's how we can construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify Funds with High Non-Investment Grade Exposure**: We will filter funds where the non-investment grade credit spread is significant, indicating potential high credit risk.

2. **Select Relevant Information**: We will select the series name and the non-investment grade credit spread for these funds.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.SERIES_NAME,
    F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
WHERE 
    CAST(F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST AS FLOAT) > 0
ORDER BY 
    CAST(F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST AS FLOAT) DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **F.SERIES_NAME**: This column provides the name of the fund series.
- **F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST**: This column indicates the credit spread for non-investment grade holdings at a 10-year maturity. A higher value suggests greater exposure to non-investment grade securities, which could imply higher credit risk.
- **CAST(F.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST AS FLOAT) > 0**: This condition filters funds with non-zero non-investment grade credit spreads, focusing on those with potential credit risk.
- **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by the non-investment grade credit spread in descending order to highlight funds with the highest exposure.
