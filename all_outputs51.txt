classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most foreign currency exposure, particularly in emerging markets, we need to analyze the data related to currency exposure. The relevant information is likely contained in the "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" table, which includes currency codes and interest rate risk data. Additionally, we may need to consider the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to identify specific funds and their characteristics.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" for currency exposure details.
   - "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" for fund identification and additional attributes.

2. **Join Requirement**: 
   - We need to join "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" with "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" using the foreign key relationship: `INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Filter for Emerging Markets**: 
   - We need to filter the results to focus on emerging markets. This might involve checking the "CURRENCY_CODE" in "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" against a list of currencies typically associated with emerging markets.

4. **Aggregation and Sorting**: 
   - Aggregate the exposure data to determine which funds have the highest exposure.
   - Sort the results to identify the top funds with the most exposure.

Given these steps, the query involves joining tables and possibly aggregating data, but it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT fund_reported_info.accession_number, COUNT(interest_rate_risk.currency_code) AS exposure_count
FROM interest_rate_risk
JOIN fund_reported_info ON interest_rate_risk.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
WHERE interest_rate_risk.currency_code IN ('EMG1', 'EMG2', 'EMG3') -- Replace with actual emerging market currency codes
GROUP BY fund_reported_info.accession_number
ORDER BY exposure_count DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of funds ordered by their exposure to emerging market currencies, helping to identify which funds have the most foreign currency exposure in these markets.
