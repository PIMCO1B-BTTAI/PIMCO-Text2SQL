classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me the top 20 largest funds by total assets" involves retrieving data from the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically the "total_assets" column. Since we are only interested in the largest funds by total assets, we can achieve this by sorting the results in descending order and limiting the output to the top 20 entries. This operation does not require any JOINs or nested queries, as it involves a straightforward selection and sorting operation on a single table. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
