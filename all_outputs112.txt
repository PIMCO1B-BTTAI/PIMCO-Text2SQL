================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "What percentage of bonds have missed interest payments by sector?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `DEBT_SECURITY`: This table contains the `ARE_ANY_INTEREST_PAYMENT` column, which indicates if there are any missed interest payments.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: This table might contain information about the sector or category of the holding, which we need to group by to calculate the percentage by sector.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `DEBT_SECURITY` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` using the `HOLDING_ID` to get the sector information for each bond.

3. **Calculations**:
   - We need to calculate the total number of bonds in each sector and the number of bonds with missed interest payments in each sector.
   - The percentage can then be calculated as (Number of bonds with missed payments / Total number of bonds) * 100 for each sector.

4. **Query Type**:
   - This query requires a JOIN between `DEBT_SECURITY` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to get the necessary information.
   - It does not require nested queries, as the calculations can be done using aggregate functions and grouping.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    issue_title AS sector,
    COUNT(debt_security.holding_id) AS total_bonds,
    SUM(CASE WHEN are_any_interest_payment = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missed_payments,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN are_any_interest_payment = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(debt_security.holding_id)) AS percentage_missed
FROM 
    debt_security
JOIN 
    debt_security_ref_instrument ON debt_security.holding_id = debt_security_ref_instrument.holding_id
GROUP BY 
    issue_title;
```

This query will provide the percentage of bonds with missed interest payments by sector.
