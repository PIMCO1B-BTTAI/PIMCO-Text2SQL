classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most cash on hand, we need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` column, which represents cash holdings or equivalents not categorized in specific asset parts. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify Relevant Table and Column**: The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` column, which is directly related to the cash on hand for funds.

2. **No Need for JOINs**: Since the question only requires information from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, there is no need to join with other tables.

3. **No Nested Queries Required**: The task is straightforward as it involves selecting and possibly ordering the funds based on their cash holdings. This can be done with a simple SQL query using `ORDER BY` to sort the funds by the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` column in descending order to find those with the most cash.

Given these points, the SQL query does not require any JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "EASY."
