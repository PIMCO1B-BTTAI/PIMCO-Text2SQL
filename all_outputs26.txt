classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have the most cash on hand?" involves identifying funds with the highest cash amounts. The relevant schema links indicate that the "fund_reported_info" table contains the "cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d" column, which likely represents cash on hand. 

To determine which funds have the most cash, we need to:

1. Access the "cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d" column from the "fund_reported_info" table.
2. Sort the funds based on this cash value in descending order to identify those with the most cash.

Since this operation involves only the "fund_reported_info" table and does not require data from other tables, there is no need for a JOIN. Additionally, the query does not require nested operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection and sorting operation on a single table without the need for JOINs or nested queries.
