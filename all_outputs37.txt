classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to consider the tables and relationships involved:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query is likely to involve the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to identify funds and potentially the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to determine if the fund is equity-focused. The `SECURITIES_LENDING` table might also be relevant if it provides information about the fund's focus.

2. **Joins**: Since the query involves identifying equity-focused funds, it may require joining `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to check the type of assets held by the fund. This is because the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains details about the holdings, which can indicate if a fund is equity-focused.

3. **Nested Queries**: The query does not seem to require nested queries, as it primarily involves filtering and joining tables to identify equity-focused funds.

Given these considerations, the query requires a join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to determine the nature of the fund's holdings. However, it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To find all equity-focused funds, we need to identify funds whose series names indicate an equity focus. This can be done by searching for keywords like "EQUITY" in the `SERIES_NAME` column of the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify the Table and Column**: We need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `SERIES_NAME` column, to find funds with an equity focus.

2. **Filter for Equity-Focused Funds**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the `SERIES_NAME` for entries containing the keyword "EQUITY".

3. **Select Relevant Information**: We can select the `SERIES_NAME` and any other relevant columns that might be of interest, such as `ACCESSION_NUMBER` or `TOTAL_ASSETS`.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    ACCESSION_NUMBER,
    SERIES_NAME,
    TOTAL_ASSETS
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE 
    SERIES_NAME LIKE '%EQUITY%'
```

This query will return all funds that have "EQUITY" in their series name, indicating an equity focus.
