classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to identify the relevant tables and columns involved in the query.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - The query is looking for "equity-focused funds." This suggests that we need to look at the fund's asset category or type.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about funds, including the `SERIES_NAME` and potentially other attributes that could indicate the fund's focus.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains an `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding. This is likely where we would identify if a fund is equity-focused.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins or Nested Queries:**
   - To find equity-focused funds, we need to check the `ASSET_CAT` in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table for entries related to equities.
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the series name or other identifying information about the fund.
   - This requires a join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`.

3. **Classification:**
   - Since the query requires a join between two tables (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`), it is classified as "NON-NESTED."
   - There is no need for nested queries as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT series_name
FROM fund_reported_info
JOIN fund_reported_holding ON fund_reported_info.accession_number = fund_reported_holding.accession_number
WHERE fund_reported_holding.asset_cat = 'Equity';
```

This query will return the names of all funds that have holdings categorized as equities, effectively identifying equity-focused funds.
