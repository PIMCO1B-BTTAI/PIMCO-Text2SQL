classification reasoning: The query "How does PIMCO's credit quality distribution compare to industry averages by quarter?" involves comparing PIMCO's credit quality distribution with industry averages. This requires:

1. Identifying PIMCO's data, which involves filtering the "registrant" table for PIMCO's records.
2. Accessing credit quality data, which is likely stored in the "fund_reported_info" table under columns like "credit_spread_3mon_invest" and others.
3. Calculating industry averages, which involves aggregating data across all registrants for comparison.
4. Comparing PIMCO's data to these industry averages, which involves joining or combining results from multiple queries.

Given these steps, the query will require:
- A join between the "registrant" and "fund_reported_info" tables to access PIMCO's credit quality data.
- Aggregation to calculate industry averages.
- A comparison between PIMCO's data and the calculated averages.

Since the query involves multiple tables and requires aggregation and comparison, it will likely involve nested queries or complex joins. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the question "How does PIMCO's credit quality distribution compare to industry averages by quarter?", we need to calculate the average credit quality metrics for PIMCO and compare them to the industry averages for each quarter. This involves using the `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST` and `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST` columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, and linking it with the `REGISTRANT` table to filter for PIMCO.

Here's how we can construct the SQL query:

```sql
WITH CreditMetrics AS (
    SELECT 
        f.QUARTER,
        r.REGISTRANT_NAME,
        f.SERIES_NAME,
        CAST(f.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST AS FLOAT) as Investment_Grade,
        CAST(f.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST AS FLOAT) as Non_Investment_Grade,
        CAST(f.TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT) as Total_Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO f
        JOIN REGISTRANT r ON f.ACCESSION_NUMBER = r.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        f.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST IS NOT NULL 
        OR f.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
),
PIMCOStats AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        AVG(Investment_Grade) as PIMCO_Inv_Grade,
        AVG(Non_Investment_Grade) as PIMCO_Non_Inv_Grade,
        SUM(Total_Assets) as PIMCO_Total_Assets
    FROM 
        CreditMetrics
    WHERE 
        REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
    GROUP BY 
        QUARTER
),
IndustryStats AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        AVG(Investment_Grade) as Industry_Inv_Grade,
        AVG(Non_Investment_Grade) as Industry_Non_Inv_Grade,
        SUM(Total_Assets) as Industry_Total_Assets
    FROM 
        CreditMetrics
    GROUP BY 
        QUARTER
)
SELECT 
    p.QUARTER,
    p.PIMCO_Inv_Grade,
    i.Industry_Inv_Grade,
    p.PIMCO_Non_Inv_Grade,
    i.Industry_Non_Inv_Grade,
    (p.PIMCO_Total_Assets / i.Industry_Total_Assets * 100) as PIMCO_Market_Share
FROM 
    PIMCOStats p
    JOIN IndustryStats i ON p.QUARTER = i.QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    p.QUARTER DESC;
```

### Explanation:
1. **CreditMetrics CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) selects the necessary credit spread and total assets data, joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `REGISTRANT`
