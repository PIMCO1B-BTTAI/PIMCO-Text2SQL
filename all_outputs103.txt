classification reasoning: To answer the question "How does PIMCO's credit quality distribution compare to industry averages by quarter?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Data**: We need to filter the data to only include records related to PIMCO. This involves using the `REGISTRANT` table to find entries where `REGISTRANT_NAME` is "PIMCO".

2. **Credit Quality Distribution**: The credit quality distribution can be inferred from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically using columns related to credit spreads such as `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_INVEST`, etc.

3. **Industry Averages**: To compare PIMCO's data to industry averages, we need to calculate the average credit quality distribution across all registrants for each quarter. This requires aggregating data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

4. **Quarterly Comparison**: The comparison needs to be done on a quarterly basis. This might involve using a date function to extract the quarter from the `FILING_DATE` in the `SUBMISSION` table.

5. **Join Operations**: We need to join the `REGISTRANT`, `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, and `SUBMISSION` tables to get the necessary data for PIMCO and the industry.

6. **Nested Queries**: Since we need to calculate industry averages and compare them to PIMCO's data, nested queries or subqueries will be necessary to perform these calculations and comparisons.

Given these steps, the SQL query will involve multiple joins and nested queries to filter, aggregate, and compare the data. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED".

process_thesql: To address the question "How does PIMCO's credit quality distribution compare to industry averages by quarter?", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify PIMCO's Data**: We need to filter the data to only include records related to PIMCO. This can be done by using the `REGISTRANT_NAME` field in the `REGISTRANT` table to identify PIMCO.

2. **Credit Quality Distribution**: The credit quality distribution can be inferred from the credit spread data. We have several columns in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table that relate to credit spreads, such as `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_INVEST`, etc. These columns provide information on how the value of the portfolio changes with credit spread changes, which can be used to assess credit quality.

3. **Quarterly Data**: We need to aggregate this data by quarter. The `FILING_DATE` in the `SUBMISSION` table can be used to determine the quarter for each filing.

4. **Industry Averages**: To compare PIMCO's data to industry averages, we need to calculate the average credit spread changes for all registrants (not just PIMCO) for each quarter.

5. **Join Tables**: We will need to join the `REGISTRANT`, `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, and `SUBMISSION` tables to get all the necessary data.

Here's how the SQL query can be structured:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.REGISTRANT_NAME,
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.FILING_DATE) AS quarter,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_3mon_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_1yr_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_5YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_5yr_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_10yr_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_30YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_30yr_invest
FROM 
    REGISTRANT r
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO fri ON r.ACCESSION_NUMBER = fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER
JOIN 
    SUBMISSION s ON fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s.ACCESSION_NUMBER
WHERE 
    r.REGISTRANT_NAME = 'PIMCO'
GROUP BY 
    r.REGISTRANT_NAME, EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.FILING_DATE)
UNION
SELECT 
    'Industry Average' AS REGISTRANT_NAME,
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.FILING_DATE) AS quarter,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_3mon_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_1yr_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_5YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_5yr_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_10yr_invest,
    AVG(fri.CREDIT_SPREAD_30YR_INVEST) AS avg_credit_spread_30yr_invest
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO fri
JOIN 
    SUBMISSION s ON fri.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.FILING_DATE);
```

### Explanation:
- The first part of the query calculates the average credit spread changes for PIMCO by quarter.
- The second part calculates the industry average credit spread changes by quarter.
- The `UNION` operator combines these results, allowing for a direct comparison between PIMCO and the industry average for each quarter.
