================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the highest interest rate sensitivity, we need to analyze data from the "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" table, which contains information about interest rate changes and their impact on the portfolio. We would likely need to look at columns such as "INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01", "INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01", etc., to assess sensitivity.

However, to identify the specific funds, we need to link this information to the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, which contains details about the funds. This requires a JOIN operation between "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as the foreign key.

Since the query involves joining two tables to get the required information, it is classified as "NON-NESTED". This is because it requires a JOIN but does not need nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT fund_reported_info.accession_number, 
       SUM(ABS(intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01) + 
           ABS(intrst_rate_change_1yr_dv01) + 
           ABS(intrst_rate_change_5yr_dv01) + 
           ABS(intrst_rate_change_10yr_dv01) + 
           ABS(intrst_rate_change_30yr_dv01)) AS total_sensitivity
FROM interest_rate_risk
JOIN fund_reported_info ON interest_rate_risk.accession_number = fund_reported_info.accession_number
GROUP BY fund_reported_info.accession_number
ORDER BY total_sensitivity DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query calculates the total interest rate sensitivity for each fund by summing the absolute values of the interest rate changes across different maturities, then orders the funds by this sensitivity to identify those with the highest sensitivity.
