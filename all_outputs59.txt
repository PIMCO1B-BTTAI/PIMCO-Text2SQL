Schema Links for Question: Help me find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine if funds are too concentrated in specific sectors, we need to analyze the holdings of each fund and categorize them by sector. This involves examining the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, which contains information about the holdings of the fund, including asset categories. 

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - The "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table is crucial as it contains the asset category information for each holding.
   - We might also need the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to get the overall context of the fund, such as total assets, to compare against sector concentration.

2. **Determine Sector Concentration**:
   - We need to group the holdings by asset category (sector) and calculate the percentage of total assets each sector represents.
   - This requires aggregating data within the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table.

3. **Set a Threshold for Concentration**:
   - Define what constitutes "too concentrated" (e.g., a single sector representing more than 30% of the fund's total assets).

4. **SQL Query Requirements**:
   - We need to join "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" with "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" to get the total assets for each fund.
   - Calculate the percentage of each sector's holdings relative to the total assets.
   - Filter funds where any sector exceeds the defined concentration threshold.

Given these steps, the query involves joining tables and performing calculations, but it doesn't necessarily require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
    frh.ASSET_CAT, 
    SUM(frh.CURRENCY_VALUE) AS total_value, 
    SUM(frh.CURRENCY_VALUE) / SUM(SUM(frh.CURRENCY_VALUE)) OVER (PARTITION BY frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER) AS concentration_ratio
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING frh
GROUP BY 
    frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
    frh.ASSET_CAT
HAVING 
    SUM(frh.CURRENCY_VALUE) / SUM(SUM(frh.CURRENCY_VALUE)) OVER (PARTITION BY frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER) > 0.5; -- Assuming 50% as a threshold for concentration
```

This query identifies funds where more than 50% of their holdings are concentrated in a single asset category, which could indicate a potential risk of over-concentration in specific sectors. Adjust the threshold as needed based on the specific criteria for concentration.
