Schema Links for Question: Help me find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Help me find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors," we need to consider the relevant schema links provided. The relevant tables are "securities_lending" and "fund_reported_holding." 

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The question is about identifying funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors. This typically involves analyzing the distribution of holdings across different sectors.

2. **Schema Analysis**:
   - The "securities_lending" table has a column "is_loan_by_fund," which might indicate whether a fund is involved in securities lending.
   - The "fund_reported_holding" table would likely contain information about the holdings of a fund, including sector information.

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - To determine concentration in specific sectors, we would need to analyze the holdings data to see if a significant portion of the fund's assets is concentrated in a particular sector.
   - This would typically involve aggregating holdings by sector and comparing the proportions.

4. **Query Complexity**:
   - Since we need to analyze holdings data and potentially aggregate it by sector, this would involve joining the "securities_lending" table with the "fund_reported_holding" table to get the necessary data.
   - However, the question does not explicitly mention the need for nested queries, such as using subqueries or set operations like INTERSECT, UNION, or EXCEPT.

process_thesql: To find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors, we need to analyze the distribution of holdings across different sectors for each fund. A fund is considered too concentrated if a significant portion of its holdings is in a single sector. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Calculate the percentage of each fund's holdings in each sector.
2. Identify funds where a single sector accounts for a large percentage of the total holdings.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH SectorConcentration AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME,
        H.ASSET_CAT AS Sector,
        SUM(CAST(H.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT)) AS Sector_Value,
        SUM(SUM(CAST(H.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT))) OVER (PARTITION BY F.SERIES_NAME) AS Total_Fund_Value,
        (SUM(CAST(H.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT)) / SUM(SUM(CAST(H.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT))) OVER (PARTITION BY F.SERIES_NAME)) * 100 AS Sector_Percentage
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
        JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING H ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = H.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE 
        H.ASSET_CAT IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        F.SERIES_NAME, H.ASSET_CAT
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    Sector,
    ROUND(Sector_Value / 1000000, 2) AS Sector_Value_Millions,
    ROUND(Total_Fund_Value / 1000000, 2) AS Total_Fund_Value_Millions,
    ROUND(Sector_Percentage, 2) AS Sector_Percentage
FROM 
    SectorConcentration
WHERE 
    Sector_Percentage > 30 -- Assuming a threshold of 30% for concentration
ORDER BY 
    Sector_Percentage DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **SectorConcentration CTE**: This common table expression calculates the total value of holdings in each sector for each fund and computes the percentage of the fund's total value that each sector represents.
- **Main Query**: Selects funds where a single sector accounts for more than 30% of the total fund value, indicating potential concentration risk. The results are ordered by the sector percentage in descending order to highlight the most concentrated funds.
