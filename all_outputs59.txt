classification reasoning: The question "Find funds with unusual monthly return patterns - looking for potential outliers" involves analyzing the monthly return data to identify outliers. This task requires examining the "monthly_total_return" table to assess the monthly returns for potential outliers. 

To identify outliers, we might need to perform statistical analysis or comparisons, which could involve complex calculations or subqueries. However, the primary task is to analyze data from a single table, "monthly_total_return," without needing to join it with other tables.

Since the task involves analyzing data from a single table without requiring joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."
