================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Check for funds with significant counterparty exposure through their derivatives," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The question involves checking counterparty exposure through derivatives. This suggests the use of the `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` table, which contains information about counterparties involved in derivative transactions. Additionally, we may need to reference the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to link derivative counterparties to specific fund holdings.

2. **Joins Required**: Since we need to link derivative counterparties to fund holdings, a join between `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` is necessary. This is because `HOLDING_ID` is a foreign key in `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` that references `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`.

3. **Significant Exposure**: The term "significant counterparty exposure" implies a need to filter or aggregate data based on certain thresholds or criteria. This might involve calculating the total exposure per counterparty and comparing it against a predefined threshold.

4. **Classification**: Given that the query requires joining tables to link derivative counterparties with fund holdings and potentially involves aggregation or filtering based on exposure levels, it falls under the "NON-NESTED" category. This is because it requires a join but does not necessarily need nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT f.ACCESSION_NUMBER, COUNT(dc.DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY_ID) AS counterparty_count
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO f
JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING h ON f.ACCESSION_NUMBER = h.ACCESSION_NUMBER
JOIN DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY dc ON h.HOLDING_ID = dc.HOLDING_ID
GROUP BY f.ACCESSION_NUMBER
HAVING COUNT(dc.DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY_ID) > 10;  -- Assuming 10 as a threshold for significant exposure
```

In this query, we join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, and `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` tables to count the number of counterparties associated with each fund. We then filter the results to show only those funds with a counterparty count exceeding a specified threshold, indicating significant exposure. Adjust the threshold value as needed based on the specific criteria for "significant" exposure.
