================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Index' in their name" needs to identify funds based on their names. The relevant table for this information is likely the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, which contains the "SERIES_NAME" column. We need to filter the "SERIES_NAME" to find those containing the word "Index."

- The query involves only one table: "FUND_REPORTED_INFO."
- We don't need to join with any other tables since all necessary information is contained within this table.
- The query does not require nested queries, as we are simply filtering based on a condition within a single table.

Therefore, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries. The SQL query can be classified as "EASY."
