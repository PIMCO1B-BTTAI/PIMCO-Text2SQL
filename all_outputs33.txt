Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for the query. The table 'fund_reported_info' contains the column 'is_non_cash_collateral', which is directly related to the user's request.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins are necessary. Since the question only asks for funds with a specific flag, and the relevant column is in 'fund_reported_info', no joins are needed.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should focus on structuring the WHERE clause to filter records where 'is_non_cash_collateral' is true. This will directly address the user's request.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='There is no need for a GROUP BY clause or any aggregation functions, as the query is straightforward and only requires filtering based on a boolean flag.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The final SQL query will be simple, selecting all columns from 'fund_reported_info' where 'is_non_cash_collateral' is true.", helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT * FROM fund_reported_info WHERE is_non_cash_collateral = TRUE;
