classification reasoning: The question "What's the latest filing date for each fund?" requires us to determine the most recent filing date for each fund. This involves grouping the data by fund and then finding the maximum filing date within each group. The relevant table for this query is "submission," as it contains the "filing_date" and "accession_number" (which can be used to identify each fund). 

To achieve this, we need to perform a grouping operation and use an aggregate function (MAX) to find the latest filing date for each fund. This operation does not require a JOIN, as all necessary information is contained within the "submission" table. Additionally, it does not require a nested query, as the task can be accomplished with a straightforward aggregation.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT SERIES_NAME, MAX(FILING_DATE) AS Latest_Filing_Date
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
JOIN SUBMISSION ON FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER = SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY SERIES_NAME;
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The task is to find the latest filing date for each fund. This requires identifying the unique funds and determining the most recent filing date associated with each.

2. **Identifying Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about each fund, including the `SERIES_NAME` which uniquely identifies each fund.
   - The `SUBMISSION` table contains the `FILING_DATE`, which is the date of interest.

3. **Mapping Columns to the Query**:
   - `SERIES_NAME` from `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` is used to identify each fund.
   - `FILING_DATE` from `SUBMISSION` is used to find the latest date.

4. **SQL Query Structure**:
   - **JOIN**: The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table is joined with the `SUBMISSION` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, which is a common key in both tables.
   - **GROUP BY**: The query groups results by `SERIES_NAME` to ensure that the latest filing date is calculated for each fund.
   - **MAX()**: The `MAX()` function is used to find the latest `FILING_DATE` for each group of `SERIES_NAME`.

5. **Why No Nested Queries or Joins**: The task specifies that nested queries or additional joins are not needed beyond the necessary join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION`. The query efficiently uses a single join and aggregation to achieve the desired result.
