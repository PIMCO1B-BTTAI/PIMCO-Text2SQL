================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Check for funds with large outstanding commitments, delayed delivery and standby," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The question involves checking for funds with specific financial characteristics, namely "large outstanding commitments, delayed delivery, and standby." The relevant columns for these checks are likely found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which includes `delayed_delivery` and `standby_commitment`.

2. **Schema Links**: The schema links provided indicate that the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains the necessary columns (`delayed_delivery` and `standby_commitment`) to address the question. There is no indication that data from other tables is required to answer this question.

3. **Query Complexity**: Since the question involves checking conditions within a single table (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO`), there is no need for JOIN operations. Additionally, the question does not require nested queries, as it does not involve complex conditions that would necessitate subqueries or set operations (like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT).

Based on this analysis, the SQL query to answer the question would involve a simple SELECT statement with conditions applied to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Therefore, the query can be classified as "EASY."
