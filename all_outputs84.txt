classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find funds whose total assets match the maximum total assets of their registrant's state," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for total assets.
   - `REGISTRANT` for the state information.

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `REGISTRANT` on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to associate each fund with its registrant's state.

3. **Nested Query Requirement**:
   - We need to find the maximum total assets for each state. This requires a subquery to calculate the maximum total assets grouped by state.
   - Then, we need to compare each fund's total assets to the maximum total assets for its state, which involves using the result of the subquery.

Given these steps, the query involves both a join and a nested query to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains 'total_assets', and the 'registrant' table contains 'state'. These are crucial for our query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to join 'fund_reported_info' with 'registrant' on 'accession_number' to associate each fund with its registrant's state.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to calculate the maximum total assets for each state. This requires a subquery or CTE to group by 'state' and find the maximum 'total_assets'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we need to filter the funds whose 'total_assets' match the maximum 'total_assets' for their state. This involves comparing each fund's 'total_assets' with the maximum calculated in the subquery or CTE.", helpful=True)]
