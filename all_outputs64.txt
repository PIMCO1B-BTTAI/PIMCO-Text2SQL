classification reasoning: The query "Find funds that might be too leveraged through their borrowing activities" involves analyzing borrowing activities and potentially securities lending to assess leverage. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for borrowing details (`borrowing_pay_within_1yr`).
   - `SECURITIES_LENDING` for checking if loans are made by the fund (`is_loan_by_fund`).

2. **Joins Required**: 
   - A join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SECURITIES_LENDING` is necessary to combine borrowing information with securities lending activities.

3. **Nested Queries**: 
   - The query does not explicitly require nested queries. It involves filtering and joining data from two tables to assess leverage.

Given that the query requires a join between two tables but does not need nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To find funds that might be too leveraged through their borrowing activities, we need to analyze the borrowing amounts relative to their total assets. The relevant columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table are `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR`, `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, and `TOTAL_ASSETS`. We will calculate the leverage ratio as the sum of short-term and long-term borrowings divided by total assets. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:

1. **Select the necessary columns**: We need the `SERIES_NAME`, `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR`, `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, and `TOTAL_ASSETS` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Calculate the leverage ratio**: This is done by summing `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, then dividing by `TOTAL_ASSETS`.

3. **Filter and order the results**: We will filter funds where the leverage ratio is significant and order the results by the leverage ratio in descending order to identify the most leveraged funds.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
WITH LeverageAnalysis AS (
    SELECT 
        SERIES_NAME,
        CAST(BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR AS FLOAT) +
        CAST(BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR AS FLOAT) as Total_Borrowing,
        CAST(TOTAL_ASSETS AS FLOAT) as Total_Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    WHERE 
        BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR IS NOT NULL
        AND BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME,
    (Total_Borrowing / NULLIF(Total_Assets, 0) * 100) as Leverage_Ratio
FROM 
    LeverageAnalysis
WHERE 
    Total_Assets > 0
ORDER BY 
    Leverage_Ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `LeverageAnalysis` calculates the total borrowing and total assets for each fund.
- **Leverage Ratio Calculation**: The leverage ratio is calculated as `(Total_Borrowing / Total_Assets) * 100`.
- **Filtering and Ordering**: The query filters out funds with zero total assets to avoid division by zero and orders the results by the leverage ratio in descending order to highlight the most leveraged funds. The `LIMIT 10` clause restricts the output to the top 10 funds by leverage ratio.
