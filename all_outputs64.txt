================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine if funds might be too leveraged through their borrowing activities, we need to analyze data from the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, specifically focusing on the "borrowing_pay_within_1yr" column. This column provides information about the total amount the fund owes for short-term loans repayable within one year. 

Additionally, we might consider the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table to check if the fund is involved in securities lending, which could also indicate leverage. The "is_loan_by_fund" column in the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table indicates whether the fund itself is the lender of the securities.

To achieve this, we need to join the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" and "SECURITIES_LENDING" tables. The foreign key relationship between these tables is established through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" in "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" and "HOLDING_ID" in "SECURITIES_LENDING". 

Since we need to join these tables to gather the necessary information, the query requires a JOIN operation. However, it does not require nested queries, as we are not using operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT fri.accession_number
FROM fund_reported_info fri
JOIN fund_reported_holding frh ON fri.accession_number = frh.accession_number
JOIN securities_lending sl ON frh.holding_id = sl.holding_id
WHERE fri.borrowing_pay_within_1yr > 0
AND sl.is_loan_by_fund = 'Y';
```

This query will return the `accession_number` of funds that have borrowing due within one year and are involved in securities lending, indicating potential leverage.
