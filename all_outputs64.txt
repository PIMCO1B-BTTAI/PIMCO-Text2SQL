classification reasoning: To determine which securities are most actively lent out, we need to analyze the data related to securities lending. This involves examining the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table, which contains information about securities lending activities. However, to identify specific securities, we also need to reference the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, which provides details about the holdings, including the security identifiers.

The query will likely involve joining these two tables to match securities lending activities with specific securities. Since this requires a join between the "SECURITIES_LENDING" and "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" tables, the query is classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves a join but does not require nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains information about securities being lent out. The table 'fund_reported_info' with the column 'assets_attrbt_to_misc_security' seems relevant.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we should determine if any aggregation is needed. Since we are looking for the 'most actively lent out' securities, we need to count or sum the occurrences of each security.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should consider using a GROUP BY clause to aggregate the data by security and then use an ORDER BY clause to sort the results to find the most actively lent securities.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Since the schema information does not provide explicit details on lending activity, we assume 'assets_attrbt_to_misc_security' can be used to identify securities and their activity level.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should ensure the query is structured to return the securities in descending order of activity, which implies using ORDER BY with DESC.', helpful=True)]
