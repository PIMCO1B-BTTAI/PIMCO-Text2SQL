================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the query "Give me our largest derivative counterparty exposures - need to check concentration risk," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves the `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` table, which contains information about counterparties involved in derivative transactions. This table includes details such as the counterparty name and their Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).

2. **Data Required**: We need to identify the largest exposures, which implies that we need to aggregate or sum up the exposures for each counterparty and then sort or filter to find the largest ones.

3. **Joins and Relationships**: The `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table through the `HOLDING_ID`. We may need to join these tables if additional information from `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` is required to calculate or contextualize the exposure.

4. **Classification**:
   - **JOIN Requirement**: Since we are primarily focusing on the `DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY` table and potentially joining with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` to get exposure values, this involves a JOIN operation.
   - **Nested Queries**: The task does not inherently require nested queries (such as subqueries or set operations like INTERSECT, UNION, etc.) unless further filtering or complex conditions are specified.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query would require a JOIN but not necessarily a nested query. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT derivative_counterparty_id, SUM(currency_value) AS total_exposure
FROM derivative_counterparty
JOIN fund_reported_holding ON derivative_counterparty.holding_id = fund_reported_holding.holding_id
GROUP BY derivative_counterparty_id
ORDER BY total_exposure DESC;
```

This query will provide a list of derivative counterparties along with their total exposure, sorted in descending order to highlight the largest exposures, which is essential for assessing concentration risk.
