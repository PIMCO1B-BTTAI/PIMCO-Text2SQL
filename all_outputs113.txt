Schema Links for Question: What's the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities?
{'table_columns': ['convertible_security_currency.conversion_ratio', 'debt_security.maturity_date'], 'primary_keys': ['CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID', 'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID', 'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "What's the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities?", we need to analyze the schema and the requirements of the query.

1. **Identify the Tables and Columns Involved:**
   - The query involves understanding the distribution of bond ratings, which typically would require information about bonds and their ratings.
   - The relevant tables and columns identified are `convertible_security_currency.conversion_ratio` and `debt_security.maturity_date`.
   - However, bond ratings are not explicitly mentioned in the provided schema, so we might need to infer or assume that bond ratings could be part of the `debt_security` table or another related table.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins:**
   - The tables `convertible_security_currency` and `debt_security` are related through the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table via the `HOLDING_ID`.
   - To analyze the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities, we would need to join these tables to access both the maturity dates and any potential rating information.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries:**
   - The query does not explicitly require nested queries such as using `INTERSECT`, `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, `IN`, or `NOT IN`.
   - The main task is to join tables and possibly aggregate or group data to understand the distribution.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the query requires joining multiple tables to gather

process_thesql: To address the question "What's the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities?", we need to analyze the bond holdings based on their maturity dates and their credit ratings. The credit ratings can be inferred from the `FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL` in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, and the maturity information is available in the `DEBT_SECURITY` table. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:

1. **Join the necessary tables**: We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and `DEBT_SECURITY` on the `HOLDING_ID` to get both the maturity date and the credit rating.

2. **Categorize maturities**: We will categorize the bonds into short-term, medium-term, and long-term based on their maturity dates.

3. **Group by credit rating and maturity band**: We will group the results by `FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL` (credit rating) and the maturity band to get the distribution.

4. **Count and sum values**: We will count the number of bonds and sum their values for each group.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH BondDistribution AS (
    SELECT 
        h.QUARTER,
        h.FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL,
        CASE 
            WHEN d.MATURITY_DATE <= DATE('now', '+1 year') THEN 'Short_Term'
            WHEN d.MATURITY_DATE <= DATE('now', '+5 year') THEN 'Medium_Term'
            ELSE 'Long_Term'
        END as Maturity_Band,
        COUNT(*) as Bond_Count,
        SUM(CAST(h.CURRENCY_VALUE AS FLOAT)) as Total_Value
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING h
        JOIN DEBT_SECURITY d ON h.HOLDING_ID = d.HOLDING_ID
    WHERE 
        d.MATURITY_DATE IS NOT NULL
        AND h.FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        h.QUARTER,
        h.FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL,
        Maturity_Band
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL,
    Maturity_Band,
    Bond_Count,
    ROUND(Total_Value / 1000000, 2) as Value_Millions
FROM 
    BondDistribution
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC,
    FAIR_VALUE_LEVEL,
    Maturity_Band;
```

This query will provide a breakdown of bond ratings across different maturity bands, showing the number of bonds and their total value in millions for each combination of credit rating and maturity band.
