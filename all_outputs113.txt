classification reasoning: The query "List funds with monthly sales flows higher than the average for all funds" involves comparing the sales flow of each fund to the average sales flow across all funds. This requires calculating the average sales flow, which is an aggregate operation, and then comparing individual sales flows to this average. 

To achieve this, we need to:
1. Calculate the average sales flow from the `fund_reported_info` table.
2. Compare each fund's sales flow to this average.

This process involves a subquery to calculate the average sales flow, which is then used in the main query to filter funds. Therefore, the query requires a nested query.

So, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

This requires an aggregation function, specifically AVG, to compute the average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='To find funds with sales flows higher than the average, we will use a nested query.
