{'table_columns': ['convertible_security_currency.conversion_ratio', 'debt_security.maturity_date'], 'primary_keys': ['CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID', 'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID', 'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "What's the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The question involves bond ratings and maturities. The `DEBT_SECURITY` table contains information about debt securities, including `MATURITY_DATE`. However, the schema provided does not explicitly mention a column for bond ratings. Assuming bond ratings are part of the `DEBT_SECURITY` or related tables, we would need to identify the correct table and column for bond ratings.

2. **Join Requirements**: If bond ratings are in a different table than maturities, we would need to perform a join between `DEBT_SECURITY` and the table containing bond ratings. However, the schema does not provide explicit information about bond ratings, so we assume they might be part of the `DEBT_SECURITY` table or a related table.

3. **Query Type**: Since we need to analyze the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities, this involves aggregating or grouping data based on maturities and bond ratings. This typically requires a join if the data is spread across multiple tables, but without explicit information on bond ratings, we assume a single table might suffice.

Given these considerations, if bond ratings are indeed part of the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, we can classify this query as "EASY" because it involves a single table without the need for joins or nested queries. However, if bond ratings are in a different table, a join would be necessary, making it "NON-NESTED."

Since the schema does not explicitly mention bond ratings, we assume they are part of the `DEBT_SECURITY` table for this classification:

process_thesql: To address the question about the distribution of bond ratings across different maturities, we need to consider the available schema and the information it provides. However, the schema provided does not explicitly include bond ratings. Assuming that bond ratings might be indirectly inferred or associated with the maturity dates of debt securities, we can focus on the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, which contains the `MATURITY_DATE` field. 

Since bond ratings are not directly available in the schema, we will focus on the distribution of maturities, which might be a proxy for understanding the risk profile of the bonds. Here's a SQL query that retrieves the distribution of maturities from the `DEBT_SECURITY` table:

```sql
SELECT maturity_date, COUNT(*) AS number_of_bonds
FROM debt_security
GROUP BY maturity_date
ORDER BY maturity_date;
```

This query will provide a count of bonds for each maturity date, which can help in understanding the distribution of bonds across different maturities. If bond ratings were available, they would typically be included in a similar query to provide a more direct answer to the question.
