classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "I'm looking for any funds with 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name what's their total AUM?" involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Table**: The table `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` contains information about funds, including their names and total assets under management (AUM).

2. **Filter by Fund Name**: We need to filter the funds whose `SERIES_NAME` contains the keywords 'sustainable' or 'ESG'. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause with a `LIKE` condition.

3. **Calculate Total AUM**: The total AUM can be calculated by summing up the `TOTAL_ASSETS` for the filtered funds.

Since this query involves filtering and aggregation within a single table (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO`), it does not require any JOIN operations or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. Since the question is about funds and their AUM, we need to find a table that contains fund names and their AUM.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to aggregate the AUM for funds that match the criteria, so a SUM function will be necessary.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter fund names containing 'sustainable' or 'ESG'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the schema information provided is limited, we assume there is a table that contains fund names and their AUM. We will use a WHERE clause to filter fund names and a SUM function to calculate total AUM.', helpful=True)]

SQL: SELECT SUM(AUM) AS total_aum FROM funds WHERE fund_name LIKE '%sustainable%' OR fund_name LIKE '%ESG%';
