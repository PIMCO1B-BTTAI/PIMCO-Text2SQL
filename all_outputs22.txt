Schema Links for Question: Show me all Fidelity funds
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show me all Fidelity funds," we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The key information we need is the name of the funds, specifically those associated with "Fidelity."

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about funds, including the `SERIES_NAME`, which likely includes the fund name.
   - The `REGISTRANT` table contains the `REGISTRANT_NAME`, which could be used to identify funds associated with "Fidelity."

2. **Determine the Need for Joins or Nested Queries:**
   - We need to filter funds based on the registrant name containing "Fidelity." This requires checking the `REGISTRANT_NAME` in the `REGISTRANT` table.
   - We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key to link the registrant to the fund.

3. **Classification:**
   - Since we need to join the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables to filter funds based on the registrant name, this requires a JOIN operation.
   - The query does not require nested queries, as we are not using operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a JOIN but not nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT registrant_name 
FROM registrant 
WHERE registrant_name LIKE '%Fidelity%';
```

This query will return all funds where the registrant name includes "Fidelity."
