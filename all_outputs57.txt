Schema Links for Question: Help me find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine if a fund is too concentrated in specific sectors, we need to analyze the holdings of the fund and assess the distribution of investments across different sectors. This requires examining the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table to understand the asset categories and their respective percentages in the fund's portfolio.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: We need to look at the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table to get information about the holdings and their asset categories.

2. **Determine Concentration**: We need to calculate the percentage of the fund's net assets that are invested in each sector. This involves aggregating the percentages of holdings by asset category.

3. **Set a Threshold**: Define a threshold to determine what constitutes "too concentrated." For example, if more than 30% of the fund's assets are in a single sector, it might be considered too concentrated.

4. **SQL Query Requirements**:
   - We need to aggregate data by asset category.
   - We need to filter or sort based on the percentage of net assets.

5. **Classification**:
   - This task involves aggregating data and potentially filtering based on a calculated threshold. It requires a JOIN if we need to combine data from multiple tables, but primarily it involves aggregation within a single table.
   - Since it doesn't require nested queries but may involve JOINs if additional data is needed from other tables, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The schema information provided mentions the 'securities_lending' table, which seems to be related to fund holdings. We need to determine if this table contains sector information or if another table is needed.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are looking for funds concentrated in specific sectors, we need to aggregate holdings by sector and calculate the concentration for each fund.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the total holdings per sector for each fund. This will simplify the main query by allowing us to easily filter funds with high concentration in a single sector.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to identify the relevant columns for the SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY clauses. This includes fund identifiers, sector identifiers, and any necessary aggregation functions to calculate concentration.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause to filter funds with high concentration. This might involve setting a threshold for what constitutes 'too concentrated' in a sector.", helpful=True)]
