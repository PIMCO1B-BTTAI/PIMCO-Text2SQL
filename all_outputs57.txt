classification reasoning: The query "Looking for funds that might have liquidity issues - check their cash versus short-term obligations" involves analyzing data related to cash and short-term obligations. The relevant tables and columns are:

- `fund_reported_info.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` for cash information.
- `fund_reported_info.total_liabilities` for liabilities.
- `debt_security_ref_instrument.issue_title` and `securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund` for additional context on obligations.

To assess liquidity issues, we need to compare cash against short-term obligations, which might involve joining or aggregating data from multiple tables. The foreign keys indicate relationships between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and other tables like `DEBT_SECURITY_REF_INSTRUMENT` and `SECURITIES_LENDING`.

Given the need to potentially join multiple tables to gather all necessary data for the analysis, this query would require a JOIN. However, it doesn't necessarily require nested queries unless specific conditions or subqueries are needed for more complex filtering.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves JOINs but not nested queries.

FROM 
    LiquidityAnalysis
WHERE 
    Short_Term_Obligations > 0
ORDER BY 
    Cash_Coverage_Ratio ASC
LIMIT 15;
```

This query identifies funds with potential liquidity issues by calculating the cash coverage ratio and ordering the results to highlight those with the lowest ratios.
