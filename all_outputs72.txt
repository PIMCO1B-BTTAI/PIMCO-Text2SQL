classification reasoning: To address the query "Show me quarterly changes in securities lending activity," we need to consider the following:

1. **Relevant Tables**: The query involves securities lending activity, which is likely captured in the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table. However, to determine quarterly changes, we need to associate this data with time periods, which might involve the `SUBMISSION` table for filing dates or reporting periods.

2. **Data Relationships**: The `SECURITIES_LENDING` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table via the `HOLDING_ID`. The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table through the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, which can then be linked to the `SUBMISSION` table to get the reporting periods.

3. **Quarterly Changes**: To calculate quarterly changes, we need to group the data by quarters. This requires joining the `SECURITIES_LENDING` data with the `SUBMISSION` table to access the `REPORT_ENDING_PERIOD` or `FILING_DATE` and then aggregating the data by quarter.

4. **SQL Complexity**: The query will require joining multiple tables to gather all necessary information and then performing aggregation to calculate changes over quarters. This involves using JOIN operations but does not necessarily require nested queries.

Given these considerations, the SQL query will involve JOIN operations across multiple tables to gather the necessary data for quarterly analysis. However, it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('quarter', s.REPORT_ENDING_PERIOD) AS quarter,
    COUNT(sl.HOLDING_ID) AS total_lending_activities,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sl.IS_CASH_COLLATERAL = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cash_collateral_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sl.IS_NON_CASH_COLLATERAL = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS non_cash_collateral_count
FROM 
    SECURITIES_LENDING sl
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING frh ON sl.HOLDING_ID = frh.HOLDING_ID
JOIN 
    SUBMISSION s ON frh.ACCESSION_NUMBER = s.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY 
    quarter
ORDER BY 
    quarter;
```

This query calculates the total number of securities lending activities per quarter, along with counts of activities involving cash and non-cash collateral. It uses the `DATE_TRUNC` function to group the data by quarter based on the `REPORT_ENDING_PERIOD` from the `SUBMISSION` table.
