classification reasoning: To determine the complexity of the SQL query needed to answer the question "Show me quarterly changes in securities lending activity," we need to consider the tables and relationships involved:

1. **Tables Involved**: The question is about securities lending activity, which is likely related to the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table. To track changes quarterly, we might also need to reference the `SUBMISSION` table for the report dates or quarters.

2. **Joins Required**: Since the `SECURITIES_LENDING` table is linked to the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table via the `HOLDING_ID`, and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` is linked to `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` via `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, we will need to join these tables to get the relevant data. Additionally, to get the quarterly information, we might need to join with the `SUBMISSION` table.

3. **Nested Queries**: The question does not inherently require nested queries. We are primarily interested in joining tables to get the data and then possibly aggregating or ordering it by quarter.

Given these considerations, the query will involve multiple table joins but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

     COUNT(DISTINCT SERIES_NAME)) as Lending_Percentage
FROM 
    LendingActivity
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY

```

This query will provide a quarterly breakdown of securities lending activity, showing the number of funds involved in lending, the total number of funds,
