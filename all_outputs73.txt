classification reasoning: The query "What's the quarterly trend in average monthly returns?" involves analyzing data over time to identify trends. This requires calculating averages of monthly returns and grouping them by quarter. The relevant tables are "monthly_total_return" for the return data and "registrant" for the quarter information. 

To achieve this, we need to join the "monthly_total_return" table with the "registrant" table using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as the foreign key. This allows us to group the data by quarter and calculate the average monthly returns for each quarter.

Since the query requires a JOIN to combine data from multiple tables but does not require any nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine the quarterly trend in average monthly returns, we need to focus on the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, which contains the monthly return data for each fund. We will calculate the average returns for each month across all funds for each quarter.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Identify the Relevant Columns**: We need the `QUARTER` and the monthly return columns (`MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`) from the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table.

2. **Calculate Averages**: For each quarter, calculate the average of `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`.

3. **Group by Quarter**: Group the results by `QUARTER` to get the average returns for each month in each quarter.

4. **Order the Results**: Order the results by `QUARTER` to see the trend over time.

Now, let's construct the SQL query based on this plan:

```sql
WITH MonthlyReturns AS (
    SELECT 
        QUARTER,
        CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) as Return1,
        CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) as Return2,
        CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT) as Return3
    FROM 
        MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN
    WHERE 
        MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 IS NOT NULL
        AND MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 IS NOT NULL
        AND MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    QUARTER,
    AVG(Return1) as Avg_Month1_Return,
    AVG(Return2) as Avg_Month2_Return,
    AVG(Return3) as Avg_Month3_Return
FROM 
    MonthlyReturns
GROUP BY 
    QUARTER
ORDER BY 
    QUARTER DESC;
```

This query calculates the average monthly returns for each quarter and orders the results by quarter in descending order, allowing us to observe the trend over time.
