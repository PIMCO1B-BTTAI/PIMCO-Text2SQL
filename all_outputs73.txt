================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the quarterly trend in average monthly returns, we need to analyze data from the "monthly_total_return" table, which contains monthly return information. The query requires calculating the average monthly returns and then aggregating them by quarter. 

1. **Tables Involved**: The primary table involved is "monthly_total_return" for the monthly return data. The "registrant" table might be involved if we need to link the returns to specific quarters, but the schema provided does not explicitly mention a "quarter" column in the "registrant" table. 

2. **Operations Needed**: 
   - Calculate the average of monthly returns (MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1, MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2, MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3).
   - Group the results by quarter, which might require joining with another table if the quarter information is not directly available in "monthly_total_return".

3. **Joins and Nested Queries**: 
   - If the quarter information is directly available in the "monthly_total_return" table, a simple aggregation without joins or nested queries would suffice.
   - If the quarter information is not directly available, a join with another table (possibly "registrant" if it contains quarter information) would be necessary.

Given the schema links provided, it seems like there might be a need to join with another table to get the quarter information, but the exact details are not clear from the schema. However, since the task primarily involves aggregation and possibly a join, it does not inherently require nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it likely involves a join but does not require nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.filing_date) AS quarter,
    AVG((mtr.monthly_total_return1 + mtr.monthly_total_return2 + mtr.monthly_total_return3) / 3) AS average_monthly_return
FROM 
    submission s
JOIN 
    monthly_total_return mtr ON s.accession_number = mtr.accession_number
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM s.filing_date)
ORDER BY 
    quarter;
```

This query calculates the average monthly return for each quarter by joining the `SUBMISSION` and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` tables, grouping by the quarter extracted from the filing date, and averaging the monthly returns.
