submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.
