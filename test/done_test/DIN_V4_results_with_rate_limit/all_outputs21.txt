Schema Links for Question: List all registrants with their country
{'table_columns': ['registrant.country', 'registrant.registrant_name'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all registrants with their country" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically the columns "registrant_name" and "country." Since all the required information is contained within a single table, we don't need to perform any JOIN operations. Additionally, there is no need for nested queries as the query is straightforward and involves a simple selection of columns. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT REGISTRANT_NAME, COUNTRY
FROM REGISTRANT;
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Schema Analysis**: The task is to list all registrants along with their country. The relevant table for this information is the `REGISTRANT` table, which contains both the `REGISTRANT_NAME` and `COUNTRY` columns.

2. **Query Plan**: 
   - We need to retrieve the `REGISTRANT_NAME` and `COUNTRY` from the `REGISTRANT` table.
   - There is no need for any joins or nested queries because all the required information is contained within a single table.

3. **SQL Query Explanation**:
   - `SELECT REGISTRANT_NAME, COUNTRY`: This clause specifies the columns we want to retrieve from the `REGISTRANT` table.
   - `FROM REGISTRANT`: This clause specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.

4. **No Additional Clauses**: 
   - There are no conditions or filters specified in the question, so no `WHERE` clause is needed.
   - There is no need for ordering or limiting the results, as the question does not specify any such requirements.
