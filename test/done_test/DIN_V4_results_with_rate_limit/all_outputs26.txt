classification reasoning: To address the query "Looking for funds that might have liquidity issues - check their cash versus short-term obligations," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` for cash and liabilities information.
   
2. **Relevant Columns**:
   - `fund_reported_info.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` for cash information.
   - `fund_reported_info.total_liabilities` for liabilities information.

3. **Analysis**:
   - We need to compare the cash available (`cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d`) against short-term obligations, which could be part of `total_liabilities` or other specific short-term liabilities columns if they exist.
   - This requires examining the cash position relative to liabilities to identify potential liquidity issues.

4. **Query Type**:
   - Since the information is contained within a single table (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO`), we do not need to perform any JOIN operations.
   - The query does not require nested queries as we are simply comparing values within the same table.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward comparison of columns within a single table without the need for JOINs or nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
WITH LiquidityCheck AS (
    SELECT 
        ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D, 
        TOTAL_LIABILITIES
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
)
SELECT 
    ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
    CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D, 
    TOTAL_LIABILITIES
FROM 
    LiquidityCheck
WHERE 
    CAST(CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D AS FLOAT) < CAST(TOTAL_LIABILITIES AS FLOAT);
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Nested Query Decision**: 
   - The task does not require nested queries or joins, as the necessary information is contained within a single table, `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

2. **Query Plan**:
   - The goal is to identify funds with potential liquidity issues by comparing their cash holdings (`CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`) against their total liabilities (`TOTAL_LIABILITIES`).
   - We need to select funds where cash is less than total liabilities, indicating potential liquidity issues.

3. **Clause Explanation**:
   - **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: `LiquidityCheck` is used to select relevant columns (`ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`, `TOTAL_LIABILITIES`) from `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.
   - **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`, and `TOTAL_LIABILITIES` for funds that might have liquidity issues.
   - **WHERE Clause**: Filters funds where the cash (`CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`) is less than the total liabilities (`TOTAL_LIABILITIES`). The `CAST` function is used to ensure numerical comparison by converting text to float.
