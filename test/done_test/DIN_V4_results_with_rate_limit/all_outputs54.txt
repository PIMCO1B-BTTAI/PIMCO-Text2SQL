classification reasoning: To determine if a fund is too concentrated in specific sectors, we need to analyze the distribution of its holdings across different asset categories or sectors. This requires examining the holdings data, which is likely stored in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table. We would need to calculate the percentage of the fund's net assets allocated to each sector and identify those with a high concentration.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains information about the holdings of the fund, including asset categories.

2. **Determine Concentration**: We need to calculate the percentage of net assets allocated to each asset category. This involves aggregating the holdings by asset category and comparing them to the total net assets of the fund.

3. **Classification**: Since this task involves aggregating data and potentially comparing it to thresholds to determine concentration, it may require a JOIN to access net asset values from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. However, if the concentration can be determined solely from the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, it might not require a JOIN.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the potential need to compare holdings against total net assets, this task is likely to require a JOIN between `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`. However, it does not necessarily require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the query "Help me find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors," we need to identify funds with a high concentration in particular asset categories or sectors. This involves analyzing the percentage of each asset category within a fund's portfolio and identifying those with a significant portion of their assets in a single category.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains information about the holdings of each fund, including the `ASSET_CAT` (asset category) and `PERCENTAGE` (percentage of the holding relative to the fund's net assets).
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table provides the `SERIES_NAME` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER` for each fund.

2. **Calculate Concentration:**
   - We need to calculate the total percentage of each asset category within each fund. If a fund has a high percentage in a single category, it might be considered too concentrated.

3. **Determine Threshold for Concentration:**
   - A threshold can be set to determine what constitutes "too concentrated." For this example, let's assume a fund is too concentrated if more than 50% of its assets are in a single category.

4. **SQL Query Construction:**
   - Use a `WITH` clause to create a common table expression (CTE) that calculates the total percentage of each asset category within each fund.
   - Filter the results to find funds where any single asset category exceeds the concentration threshold.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH FundConcentration AS (
    SELECT 
        FH.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        FH.ASSET_CAT, 
        SUM(CAST(FH.PERCENTAGE AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Percentage
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FH
    GROUP BY 
        FH.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        FH.ASSET_CAT
),
ConcentratedFunds AS (
    SELECT 
        FC.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        FC.ASSET_CAT, 
        FC.Total_Percentage
    FROM 
        FundConcentration FC
    WHERE 
        FC.Total_Percentage > 50.0
)
SELECT 
    FRI.SERIES_NAME, 
    CF.ASSET_CAT, 
    CF.Total_Percentage
FROM 
    ConcentratedFunds CF
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI ON CF.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER
ORDER BY 
    CF.Total_Percentage DESC;
```

### Explanation:

- **FundConcentration CTE:** This calculates the total percentage of each asset category within each fund by summing the `PERCENTAGE` values for each `ASSET_CAT` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
- **ConcentratedFunds CTE:** Filters the results to include only those funds where any single asset category exceeds 50% of the fund's total assets.
- **Final SELECT Statement:** Joins the `ConcentratedFunds` CTE with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to retrieve the `SERIES_NAME` of the funds, along with the asset category and its total percentage, ordered by the concentration level in descending order.
