classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name" would involve searching for fund names that contain the word "Growth." This can be done using a simple query on the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically on the "series_name" column. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To solve the query "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name," we need to identify the table and column that contain the fund names. Based on the provided schema, the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains a column named `SERIES_NAME`, which represents the official name assigned to the series or individual fund. This is the column we need to query to find funds with 'Growth' in their name.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT SERIES_NAME
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE SERIES_NAME LIKE '%Growth%';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the `SERIES_NAME` column because it contains the names of the funds.

2. **FROM Clause**: We specify the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table because it holds the information about the funds, including their names.

3. **WHERE Clause**: We use the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'%Growth%'` to filter fund names that contain the word 'Growth'. The `%` wildcard allows for any sequence of characters before and after 'Growth', ensuring we capture all relevant fund names.

This query will return all fund names from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table that include the word 'Growth'.
