classification reasoning: To answer the question "How are our largest funds positioned in terms of credit quality?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Largest Funds**: We need to determine which funds are considered the largest. This typically involves looking at the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to identify funds with the highest asset values.

2. **Credit Quality Positioning**: To understand the credit quality positioning, we would likely need to examine columns related to credit spreads, such as `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_INVEST`, etc., in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. These columns provide insights into how the fund's portfolio is affected by changes in credit spreads, which is a measure of credit quality.

3. **Data from a Single Table**: Since both the size of the funds (via `TOTAL_ASSETS`) and the credit quality measures (via credit spread columns) are available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, we do not need to join multiple tables.

4. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require nested queries as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. We are simply filtering and selecting data from a single table.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves selecting and filtering data from a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.

process_thesql: To address the question "How are our largest funds positioned in terms of credit quality?" we need to focus on the credit quality metrics available in the database schema. The relevant table for this information is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains columns related to credit spreads for different maturities and investment grades.

The task requires us to identify the largest funds and then examine their credit quality. The largest funds can be determined by their `TOTAL_ASSETS`. Once we have identified the largest funds, we can look at their credit quality using the `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST` and other similar columns.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH LargestFunds AS (
    SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER, SERIES_NAME, TOTAL_ASSETS
    FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
    ORDER BY TOTAL_ASSETS DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT LF.SERIES_NAME, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVEST, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_INVEST, 
       FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_5YR_INVEST, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_INVEST, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_30YR_INVEST,
       FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_NONINVEST, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_NONINVEST, 
       FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_5YR_NONINVEST, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST, FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_30YR_NONINVEST
FROM LargestFunds LF
JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI ON LF.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - LargestFunds**: 
   - We first create a CTE to identify the largest funds by selecting the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `SERIES_NAME`, and `TOTAL_ASSETS` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.
   - We order the results by `TOTAL_ASSETS` in descending order to get the largest funds.
   - We limit the results to the top 10 largest funds.

2. **Main Query**:
   - We select the `SERIES_NAME` and various credit spread columns from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for the largest funds identified in the CTE.
   - The credit spread columns include both investment-grade and non-investment-grade spreads for different maturities (3 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years).
   - We join the `LargestFunds` CTE with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table on `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the credit quality metrics for these funds.

This query provides a comprehensive view of how the largest funds are positioned in terms of credit quality by examining their credit spreads across different maturities and investment grades.
