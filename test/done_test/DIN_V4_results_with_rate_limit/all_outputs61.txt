classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each investment company manage?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each investment company. This involves counting the number of distinct funds (or series) for each registrant or investment company.

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the tables involved: The "REGISTRANT" table contains information about the investment companies, and the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table contains information about the funds or series managed by these companies.

2. Establish the relationship: The "ACCESSION_NUMBER" is a common key between the "REGISTRANT" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" tables, allowing us to join these tables.

3. Perform the aggregation: We need to group the data by the investment company (likely using the "REGISTRANT_NAME" or "CIK" from the "REGISTRANT" table) and count the number of distinct funds (using "SERIES_ID" from the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table).

Since this query involves joining two tables and performing an aggregation, it requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification: "NON-NESTED"

process_thesql: To answer the question "How many funds does each investment company manage?", we need to identify the relationship between investment companies and the funds they manage. Based on the provided schema, the `REGISTRANT` table contains information about the investment companies, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the funds, including the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` which links to the `REGISTRANT` table.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Tables and Columns**: 
   - The `REGISTRANT` table has the `REGISTRANT_NAME` column, which represents the investment company.
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table has the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column, which can be linked to the `REGISTRANT` table to identify which company manages which fund.

2. **Join the Tables**: 
   - We need to join the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to associate each fund with its respective investment company.

3. **Count the Funds**: 
   - We will count the number of funds (`ACCESSION_NUMBER`) for each investment company (`REGISTRANT_NAME`).

4. **Group the Results**: 
   - We will group the results by `REGISTRANT_NAME` to get the count of funds managed by each company.

5. **SQL Query Construction**: 
   - We will use a `JOIN` to connect the tables and a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate the results by investment company.

Here is the SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
SELECT R.REGISTRANT_NAME, COUNT(F.ACCESSION_NUMBER) AS Fund_Count
FROM REGISTRANT R
JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY R.REGISTRANT_NAME;
```

**Explanation**:
- `SELECT R.REGISTRANT_NAME, COUNT(F.ACCESSION_NUMBER) AS Fund_Count`: This selects the name of the investment company and counts the number of funds they manage.
- `FROM REGISTRANT R JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER`: This joins the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link funds to their respective companies.
- `GROUP BY R.REGISTRANT_NAME`: This groups the results by the investment company name to get the count of funds for each company.
