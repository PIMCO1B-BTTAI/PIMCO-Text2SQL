classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each registrant have?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each registrant. To achieve this, we need to consider the relationship between registrants and funds. The relevant tables are "REGISTRANT" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO," where the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" serves as a foreign key linking these tables.

To answer the question, we need to perform a JOIN between the "REGISTRANT" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" tables on the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" field. After joining, we can group the results by the registrant's details (such as "REGISTRANT_NAME") and count the number of funds for each registrant.

Since this requires a JOIN but does not involve any nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To answer the question "How many funds does each registrant have?", we need to identify the relationship between registrants and funds. The relevant tables for this task are `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`. The `REGISTRANT` table contains information about the registrants, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the funds. The common link between these tables is the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, which serves as a primary key in both tables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Relationship**: Each registrant can have multiple funds. The `ACCESSION_NUMBER` in the `REGISTRANT` table is linked to the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which allows us to associate funds with their respective registrants.

2. **Count the Funds**: We need to count the number of funds for each registrant. This can be achieved by grouping the data by the registrant's name and counting the distinct `ACCESSION_NUMBER` entries in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

3. **SQL Query Structure**:
   - Use a `JOIN` to combine the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
   - Use `GROUP BY` to group the results by the registrant's name.
   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT F.ACCESSION_NUMBER)` to count the number of unique funds for each registrant.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT R.REGISTRANT_NAME, COUNT(DISTINCT F.ACCESSION_NUMBER) AS Fund_Count
FROM REGISTRANT R
JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER
GROUP BY R.REGISTRANT_NAME;
```

**Explanation**:
- `SELECT R.REGISTRANT_NAME`: Selects the name of the registrant.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT F.ACCESSION_NUMBER) AS Fund_Count`: Counts the distinct funds associated with each registrant.
- `FROM REGISTRANT R JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER`: Joins the two tables on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link registrants with their funds.
- `GROUP BY R.REGISTRANT_NAME`: Groups the results by registrant name to get the count of funds for each registrant.

final_output:
