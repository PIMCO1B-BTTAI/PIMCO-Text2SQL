classification reasoning: To determine which investment firms have the most diverse geographic exposure in their holdings, we need to analyze the data from the "fund_reported_holding" table, specifically focusing on the "investment_country" column. This task involves counting the number of unique countries associated with each firm's holdings.

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to use the "fund_reported_holding" table to access the "investment_country" column.
   - We also need to identify the investment firm, which can be linked through the "accession_number" in the "fund_reported_holding" table.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins**:
   - To identify the investment firm, we might need to join with another table that provides firm-level information, such as the "registrant" table, using the "accession_number" as a foreign key.

3. **Determine the Query Type**:
   - We need to count the number of unique countries for each firm, which requires grouping by the firm identifier (likely "accession_number") and counting distinct "investment_country" entries.
   - This operation involves a JOIN between "fund_reported_holding" and "registrant" to get the firm name or identifier, but it does not require nested queries.

Based on the above analysis, the query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

WITH GeographicDiversity AS (
    SELECT 
        FRI.SERIES_NAME, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT FRH.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY) AS Country_Count
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI ON FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER

)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME, 
    Country_Count
FROM 
    GeographicDiversity
ORDER BY 
    Country_Count DESC;
```

### Explanation:

- **WITH GeographicDiversity AS (...):** This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of distinct countries for each investment firm.
- **JOIN:** We join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link holdings with their respective firms.
- **COUNT(DISTINCT FRH.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY):** This counts the unique countries for each firm, providing a measure of geographic diversity.
- **GROUP BY FRI.SERIES_NAME:** Groups the results by the firm name to aggregate the country counts.
- **ORDER BY Country_Count DESC:** Orders the firms by their geographic diversity in descending order, so the firms with the most diverse exposure appear first.

This query will give us a list of investment firms ordered by their geographic diversity, allowing us to identify those with the most diverse geographic exposure in their holdings.
