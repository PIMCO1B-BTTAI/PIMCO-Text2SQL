classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Index' in their name" needs to identify funds with 'Index' in their name. This information is likely found in the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically in the "series_name" column. Since the query only involves filtering based on a condition within a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To solve the query "List all funds with 'Index' in their name," we need to identify the table and column that contain the fund names. Based on the provided schema, the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains a column named `SERIES_NAME`, which likely holds the names of the funds.

The task is to find all fund names that contain the word 'Index'. This can be achieved using a simple `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause that uses the `LIKE` operator to filter fund names containing the substring 'Index'.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT SERIES_NAME
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE SERIES_NAME LIKE '%Index%';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the `SERIES_NAME` column because it contains the names of the funds.

2. **FROM Clause**: We specify the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, as it holds the relevant data about fund names.

3. **WHERE Clause**: We use the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'%Index%'` to filter fund names that include the substring 'Index'. The `%` wildcard allows for any sequence of characters before and after 'Index', ensuring we capture all relevant fund names. 

This query does not require any nested queries or joins, as all necessary information is contained within a single table.
