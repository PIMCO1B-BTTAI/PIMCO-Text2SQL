classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Income' in their name" needs to identify funds based on their names. The relevant table for this task is "FUND_REPORTED_INFO," specifically the "SERIES_NAME" column, which contains the names of the funds. The query will filter the "SERIES_NAME" to find those containing the word "Income."

Since this task involves only one table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
process_thesql: To solve the query "List all funds with 'Income' in their name," we need to identify the table and column that contain the fund names. Based on the provided schema, the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains a column named `SERIES_NAME`, which represents the official name assigned to the series or individual fund. This is the column we need to query to find funds with 'Income' in their name.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT SERIES_NAME
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE SERIES_NAME LIKE '%Income%';
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Table Selection**: We use the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table because it contains the `SERIES_NAME` column, which holds the names of the funds.

2. **Column Selection**: The `SERIES_NAME` column is selected because it contains the names of the funds, which we need to filter based on the presence of the word 'Income'.

3. **Filter Condition**: The `WHERE` clause is used with the `LIKE` operator to filter fund names that contain the substring 'Income'. The `%` wildcard is used before and after 'Income' to match any fund name that contains 'Income' anywhere in the name.

4. **No Nested Queries or Joins**: The task specifies that no nested queries or join statements are needed, and this query adheres to that requirement by directly querying the relevant table and column.
