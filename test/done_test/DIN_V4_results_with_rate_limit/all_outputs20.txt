classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The query is asking for equity-focused funds. This likely involves identifying funds based on their asset category or investment focus. The relevant table for this information would be `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, specifically the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since the query is focused on identifying funds based on their asset category, it primarily involves the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table. There is no explicit need to join with other tables unless additional information about the funds is required, which is not specified in the query.

3. **Assess the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not require any complex filtering or aggregation that would necessitate a nested query. It is a straightforward selection based on a specific asset category.

Based on this analysis, the query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To answer the question "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to identify the relevant table and column that can help us determine which funds are equity-focused. Based on the provided schema, the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains a column named `ASSET_CAT`, which categorizes the asset type of the holding. This column can be used to identify equity-focused funds.

Since the task specifies that no nested queries or join statements are needed, we can directly query the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to find funds with holdings categorized as equities.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ACCESSION_NUMBER
FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING
WHERE ASSET_CAT = 'Equity';
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Table Selection**: The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table is chosen because it contains the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type and can be used to identify equity-focused funds.

2. **Column Selection**: The `ASSET_CAT` column is used to filter for equity-focused funds by checking for the value 'Equity'.

3. **Query Structure**:
   - **SELECT DISTINCT**: This is used to ensure that each fund (identified by `ACCESSION_NUMBER`) is listed only once, even if it holds multiple equity assets.
   - **FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
   - **WHERE ASSET_CAT = 'Equity'**: This condition filters the records to include only those where the asset category is 'Equity', indicating an equity-focused fund.

This query will return a list of unique `ACCESSION_NUMBER`s for funds that have holdings categorized as equities, effectively identifying equity-focused funds.

final_output: 
SELECT DISTINCT ACCESSION_NUMBER
FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING
WHERE ASSET_CAT = 'Equity'
