classification reasoning: To determine which investment styles are performing best this quarter, we need to analyze the performance data of different funds. This involves comparing the performance metrics of funds categorized by their investment styles, such as growth or value funds. 

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to look at tables that contain performance data, such as `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN`, which provides monthly returns for funds.
   - We also need to identify the investment style of each fund. This information might be found in a table that categorizes funds, but the schema provided does not explicitly mention a column for investment style. We might need to infer this from other available data or assume it's part of the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` or a similar table.

2. **Determine the Time Frame**: 
   - Since the question asks for performance "this quarter," we need to aggregate monthly returns to get quarterly performance. This requires summing or averaging the monthly returns for the current quarter.

3. **Compare Investment Styles**: 
   - Once we have the quarterly performance data, we need to group the results by investment style and compare their performance metrics.

4. **SQL Query Requirements**:
   - This task requires joining tables to combine performance data with investment style information.
   - It also involves aggregating data over a specific time frame (quarterly), which may require nested queries or subqueries to calculate the quarterly performance.

Given these steps, the query will likely involve multiple tables and require both JOIN operations and possibly nested queries to aggregate and compare data effectively. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."
