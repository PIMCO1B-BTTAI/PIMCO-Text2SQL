classification reasoning: To determine the exposure by state and check geographic concentration, we need to analyze data related to the geographic distribution of registrants or holdings. This involves aggregating data by state, which requires joining tables that contain state information with those that have financial data.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - The `REGISTRANT` table contains state information (`registrant.state`).
   - Financial data such as total assets or net assets might be in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Determine Necessary Joins**:
   - We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to associate state information with financial data. This requires a join on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` field, which is a foreign key relationship between these tables.

3. **Aggregation**:
   - We need to aggregate the financial data by state to determine the exposure. This involves using a `GROUP BY` clause on the state field and summing the relevant financial metrics.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since this query requires joining multiple tables and aggregating data, it falls under the "NON-NESTED" category. It does not require nested queries but does require a join to combine data from different tables.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: - **WITH StateExposure AS (...):** This common table expression (CTE) calculates the total exposure by state. It aggregates the total assets for each state.
- **SELECT R.STATE, SUM(F.TOTAL_ASSETS) AS Total_Exposure:** This part of the query selects the state and calculates the sum of total assets for each state.
- **FROM REGISTRANT R JOIN FUND_REPORTED_INFO F ON R.ACCESSION_NUMBER = F.ACCESSION_NUMBER:** This join operation links the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to associate each registrant with its financial data.
- **GROUP BY R.STATE:** This groups the results by state, allowing us to calculate the total exposure for each state.
- **ORDER BY Total_Exposure DESC:** This orders the results by total exposure in descending order, so the states with the highest exposure appear first.

This query provides a clear view of the geographic concentration of the funds' exposure by state.
