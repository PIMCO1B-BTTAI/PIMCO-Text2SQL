classification reasoning: To determine if funds are facing redemption pressure, we need to compare outflows (redemptions) and inflows (sales) over a period. This involves checking if redemptions consistently exceed sales for a fund. The relevant columns for this task are `fund_reported_info.sales_flow_mon1`, `fund_reported_info.redemption_flow_mon1`, and similar columns for other months if available.

1. **Identify Tables**: The primary table involved is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains both sales and redemption flow data.

2. **Determine Conditions**: We need to check if `redemption_flow_mon1` is greater than `sales_flow_mon1` and similarly for other months if applicable.

3. **No Joins Required**: Since all necessary data is within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, no joins are needed.

4. **No Nested Queries Required**: The task does not require nested queries as we are simply comparing values within the same table.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query does not require joins or nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "EASY".

```

### Reasoning:

1. **Objective**: The task is to identify funds experiencing consistent redemption pressure, where outflows exceed inflows over three consecutive months.

2. **Schema Mapping**: 
   - The relevant columns for inflows and outflows are found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table:
     - Inflows: `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON2`, `SALES_FLOW_MON3`, `REINVESTMENT_FLOW_MON3`.
     - Outflows: `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON1`, `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON2`, `REDEMPTION_FLOW_MON3`.

3. **Query Plan**:
   - **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: `FundFlows` is used to calculate the total inflows and outflows for each month by summing the sales and reinvestment flows for inflows and using the redemption flows for outflows.
   - **Selection**: The main query selects funds where outflows exceed inflows for all three months.

4. **Clauses Explanation**:
   - **CTE (`FundFlows`)**: Computes inflows and outflows for each month by casting the relevant columns to `FLOAT` for accurate arithmetic operations.
   - **Main Query**: Filters funds where outflows are greater than inflows for each of the three months, indicating consistent redemption pressure.

5. **No Nested Queries**: The use of a CTE avoids the need for nested queries, keeping the query structure simple and efficient.
