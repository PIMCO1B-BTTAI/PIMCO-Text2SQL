classification reasoning: To determine where the biggest month-over-month changes in fund flows are occurring, we need to analyze the data related to fund flows over multiple months. This involves comparing sales, reinvestment, and redemption flows across different months. The relevant columns for this analysis are likely found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains monthly sales, reinvestment, and redemption flows for three months.

To perform this analysis, we would need to calculate the changes in these flows from one month to the next. This requires accessing multiple columns within the same table and performing calculations on them. Since this involves operations within a single table and does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To address the question "Where are we seeing the biggest month-over-month changes in fund flows?" we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains columns related to fund flows for three consecutive months: `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, and `SALES_FLOW_MON3`. These columns represent the net asset value of shares sold by the fund in each of the three months.

The task is to calculate the month-over-month changes in these fund flows and identify the largest changes. We can achieve this by calculating the absolute differences between consecutive months and then finding the maximum of these differences.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH FundFlowChanges AS (
    SELECT 
        ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        SERIES_NAME,
        ABS(CAST(SALES_FLOW_MON2 AS FLOAT) - CAST(SALES_FLOW_MON1 AS FLOAT)) AS Change_Mon1_to_Mon2,
        ABS(CAST(SALES_FLOW_MON3 AS FLOAT) - CAST(SALES_FLOW_MON2 AS FLOAT)) AS Change_Mon2_to_Mon3
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO
),
MaxChanges AS (
    SELECT 
        SERIES_NAME,
        GREATEST(Change_Mon1_to_Mon2, Change_Mon2_to_Mon3) AS Max_Change
    FROM 
        FundFlowChanges
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME, 
    Max_Change
FROM 
    MaxChanges
ORDER BY 
    Max_Change DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - `FundFlowChanges`:**
   - This CTE calculates the absolute month-over-month changes in fund flows for each fund. It computes the difference between `SALES_FLOW_MON2` and `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, and between `SALES_FLOW_MON3` and `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, converting the values to `FLOAT` for accurate arithmetic operations.

2. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - `MaxChanges`:**
   - This CTE determines the maximum change for each fund by using the `GREATEST` function to compare the two calculated changes (`Change_Mon1_to_Mon2` and `Change_Mon2_to_Mon3`).

3. **Final Selection:**
   - The final `SELECT` statement retrieves the fund series name and the maximum change, ordering the results by `Max_Change` in descending order to identify the fund with the largest month-over-month change. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the fund with the biggest change is returned.
