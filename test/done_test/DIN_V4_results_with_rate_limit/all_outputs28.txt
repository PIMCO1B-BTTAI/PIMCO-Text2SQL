classification reasoning: To determine if a fund might be too leveraged through its borrowing activities, we need to analyze the borrowing-related data. The relevant columns for this task are `fund_reported_info.borrowing_pay_within_1yr` and `securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund`. 

The task involves checking the borrowing amounts and whether the fund itself is the lender of securities. This requires data from two tables: `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SECURITIES_LENDING`. The relationship between these tables is established through the foreign key `SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID`, which links `SECURITIES_LENDING` to `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` is linked to `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` through `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

Since we need to join these tables to get the necessary information, but we do not require any nested queries (like using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), this query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the query "Find funds that might be too leveraged through their borrowing activities," we need to identify funds with significant borrowing activities. The relevant columns for this task are `fund_reported_info.borrowing_pay_within_1yr` and `securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains the `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` column, which indicates the amount a fund owes within a year. This is a direct indicator of short-term leverage.
   - The `SECURITIES_LENDING` table contains the `IS_LOAN_BY_FUND` column, which indicates whether the fund is involved in securities lending. This can be an indirect indicator of leverage if the fund is lending securities to raise cash.

2. **Join the Tables**:
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SECURITIES_LENDING` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `HOLDING_ID` as the linking keys. The foreign key relationship is `SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID`, and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Filter Criteria**:
   - We are interested in funds with significant borrowing (`BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` is not null or greater than a certain threshold) and those involved in securities lending (`IS_LOAN_BY_FUND = 'Y'`).

4. **SQL Query Construction**:
   - We will select funds that meet the above criteria and list their series names and borrowing amounts.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
WITH LeveragedFunds AS (
    SELECT F.SERIES_NAME, F.BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR, S.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND
    FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING H ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = H.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    JOIN SECURITIES_LENDING S ON H.HOLDING_ID = S.HOLDING_ID
    WHERE F.BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR IS NOT NULL
      AND S.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND = 'Y'
)
SELECT SERIES_NAME, BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR
FROM LeveragedFunds;
```

**Explanation**:
- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `LeveragedFunds` is used to filter and join the necessary tables to identify funds with borrowing activities and securities lending.
- **JOIN**: We join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` and `SECURITIES_LENDING` to access the necessary columns.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters funds with non-null borrowing amounts and those involved in securities lending.
- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the series name and borrowing amount for funds that might be too leveraged.
