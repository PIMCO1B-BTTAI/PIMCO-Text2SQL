classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query needed to answer the question "What's the average yield on our defaulted bonds? Need to see recovery potential," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - The question is about defaulted bonds, which suggests we need information from the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, specifically the `IS_DEFAULT` column to identify defaulted bonds.
   - To calculate the average yield, we would need a column that represents yield or a similar financial metric. However, the schema provided does not explicitly mention a yield column. We might need to infer or calculate it from other available columns, such as `ANNUALIZED_RATE`.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**:
   - Since the question is focused on defaulted bonds, we primarily need data from the `DEBT_SECURITY` table. If the yield or related financial metric is available in this table, a JOIN might not be necessary.
   - If additional information is needed from another table to calculate or infer the yield, a JOIN would be required.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**:
   - If we need to filter or aggregate data based on conditions that require subqueries (e.g., calculating averages with specific conditions), a nested query might be necessary.
   - However, if the calculation can be done directly on the `DEBT_SECURITY` table without additional filtering or complex conditions, a nested query might not be needed.

Given the information provided and assuming the yield or related metric is directly available or calculable from the `DEBT_SECURITY` table, the query might not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, it could be classified as "EASY" if the calculation is straightforward. However, if additional data from other tables is needed to calculate the yield, it might be "NON-NESTED" due to the need for JOINs.

Without explicit details on the yield calculation, let's assume it's straightforward and classify it as "EASY."

classification: "EASY"

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT AVG(CAST(ANNUALIZED_RATE AS FLOAT)) AS Average_Yield
FROM DEBT_SECURITY
WHERE IS_DEFAULT = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT AVG(CAST(ANNUALIZED_RATE AS FLOAT))**: This calculates the average yield of the defaulted bonds. We cast `ANNUALIZED_RATE` to `FLOAT` to ensure accurate computation.
- **FROM DEBT_SECURITY**: This specifies the table from which we are retrieving data.
- **WHERE IS_DEFAULT = 'Y'**: This filters the records to include only those bonds that are in default, assuming 'Y' indicates a default status. Adjust the condition if the default indicator is different (e.g., `1` or `TRUE`).

SELECT AVG(CAST(ANNUALIZED_RATE AS FLOAT)) AS Average_Yield
FROM DEBT_SECURITY
