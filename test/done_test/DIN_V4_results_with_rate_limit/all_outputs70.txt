classification reasoning: To determine which investment firms are growing the fastest based on their asset growth, we need to analyze data from the "fund_reported_info" table, which contains information about total assets. However, to identify the investment firms, we also need to link this data with the "registrant" table, which contains the registrant names and CIKs. This requires a JOIN between the "fund_reported_info" and "registrant" tables to associate asset growth with specific firms.

Since the query involves joining two tables to get the necessary information, it is classified as "NON-NESTED." The query does not require nested queries, as we are not using operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine which investment firms are growing the fastest based on their asset growth, we need to analyze the change in net assets over time for each firm. The relevant data for this analysis is found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains information about the net assets of each fund. Additionally, we need to join this table with the `REGISTRANT` table to get the names of the investment firms.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: This table contains the `NET_ASSETS` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER` which we can use to track changes in assets over time.
   - `REGISTRANT`: This table contains the `REGISTRANT_NAME` and `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, which we can use to identify the investment firms.

2. **Calculate Asset Growth**:
   - We need to calculate the change in `NET_ASSETS` for each firm over time. This can be done by using the `LAG` function to compare the current period's net assets with the previous period's net assets.

3. **Join Tables**:
   - Join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `REGISTRANT` on `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to get the firm names.

4. **Order by Growth**:
   - Order the results by the calculated asset growth to identify the firms with the fastest growth.

5. **Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - Use CTEs to structure the query and avoid nested queries.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH AssetGrowth AS (
    SELECT 
        F.ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        R.REGISTRANT_NAME,
        F.NET_ASSETS,
        LAG(F.NET_ASSETS) OVER (PARTITION BY R.REGISTRANT_NAME ORDER BY S.REPORT_DATE) AS Previous_Net_Assets
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN 
        REGISTRANT R ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = R.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    JOIN 
        SUBMISSION S ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = S.ACCESSION_NUMBER
),
GrowthRate AS (
    SELECT 
        REGISTRANT_NAME,
        (NET_ASSETS - Previous_Net_Assets) / Previous_Net_Assets AS Growth_Rate
    FROM 
        AssetGrowth
    WHERE 
        Previous_Net_Assets IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    REGISTRANT_NAME, 
    AVG(Growth_Rate) AS Average_Growth_Rate
FROM 
    GrowthRate
GROUP BY 
    REGISTRANT_NAME
ORDER BY 
    Average_Growth_Rate DESC;
```

### Explanation:

- **CTE `AssetGrowth`**: This CTE calculates the net assets for each firm and uses the `LAG` function to get the previous period's net assets for comparison.
- **CTE `GrowthRate`**: This CTE calculates the growth rate for each firm by comparing the current and previous net assets.
- **Final SELECT**: The final query calculates the average growth rate for each firm and orders the results to show the firms with the highest average growth rate, indicating the fastest growth.
