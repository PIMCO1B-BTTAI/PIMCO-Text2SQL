classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "I'm looking for any funds with 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name what's their total AUM?" involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Table**: The query is interested in funds with specific keywords in their names and their total assets under management (AUM). The relevant table for fund names and total assets is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

2. **Filter by Fund Name**: We need to filter the `SERIES_NAME` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to find names containing 'sustainable' or 'ESG'.

3. **Select Total Assets**: We need to retrieve the `TOTAL_ASSETS` for the filtered funds.

4. **No Joins Required**: Since all the required information is contained within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, there is no need for a JOIN operation.

5. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Based on these steps, the SQL query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "EASY."

```

### Reasoning:

1. **Schema Understanding**: The task is to find funds with 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name and calculate their total Assets Under Management (AUM). The relevant table for this information is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, which contains the `SERIES_NAME` and `TOTAL_ASSETS` columns.

2. **Query Plan**:
   - **Filter Funds**: Use the `SERIES_NAME` column to filter funds that contain 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name. This is done using the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) to match any fund name containing these keywords.
   - **Calculate Total AUM**: Use the `SUM()` function to calculate the total of `TOTAL_ASSETS` for the filtered funds. The `CAST()` function is used to ensure that the `TOTAL_ASSETS` values are treated as numeric for aggregation.

3. **SQL Clauses**:
   - **SELECT**: Retrieves the sum of total assets for the funds that match the criteria.
   - **FROM**: Specifies the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table as the source of data.
   - **WHERE**: Filters the rows to include only those where `SERIES_NAME` contains 'sustainable' or 'ESG'.

This query efficiently retrieves the total AUM for funds with the specified keywords in their names without the need for nested queries or joins, as all necessary data is contained within a single table.
