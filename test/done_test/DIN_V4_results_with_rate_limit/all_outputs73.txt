classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Check for funds with large outstanding commitments, delayed delivery and standby," we need to consider the tables and columns involved:

1. **Relevant Columns**: The question involves checking for funds with large outstanding commitments, delayed delivery, and standby. The relevant columns from the schema are:
   - `fund_reported_info.delayed_delivery`
   - `fund_reported_info.standby_commitment`

2. **Tables Involved**: The relevant table for these columns is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

3. **Joins and Nested Queries**:
   - Since the question only involves columns from a single table (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO`), there is no need for a JOIN.
   - The question does not specify any conditions that would require a nested query (such as using INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN).

Based on this analysis, the SQL query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER, SERIES_NAME, DELAYED_DELIVERY, STANDBY_COMMITMENT
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE CAST(DELAYED_DELIVERY AS FLOAT) > 0 OR CAST(STANDBY_COMMITMENT AS FLOAT) > 0;
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `SERIES_NAME`, `DELAYED_DELIVERY`, and `STANDBY_COMMITMENT` columns to provide a comprehensive view of the funds with commitments.
- **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table as the source of data.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the records to include only those with non-zero values in either `DELAYED_DELIVERY` or `STANDBY_COMMITMENT`, indicating the presence of commitments. The `CAST` function is used to ensure numerical comparison, assuming these fields are stored as text.

This query will return a list of funds with outstanding commitments related to delayed delivery and standby agreements. Adjustments can be made to the threshold for "large" commitments based on specific requirements or additional context.
