classification reasoning: To determine which fund families are most active in securities lending, we need to analyze data from multiple tables. Specifically, we need to:

1. Identify the fund families, which can be derived from the "registrant" table using the "REGISTRANT_NAME" or "CIK" as identifiers.
2. Determine the activity in securities lending, which is captured in the "securities_lending" table, particularly the "IS_LOAN_BY_FUND" column.

To achieve this, we need to join the "registrant" table with the "securities_lending" table. The "securities_lending" table is linked to the "fund_reported_holding" table through the "HOLDING_ID", and the "fund_reported_holding" table is linked to the "fund_reported_info" table through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER". The "fund_reported_info" table is then linked to the "registrant" table through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER".

This requires joining multiple tables to gather the necessary information, but it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

    FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN SECURITIES_LENDING SL ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = SL.HOLDING_ID

    GROUP BY F.SERIES_NAME
)
SELECT SERIES_NAME, Lending_Activity_Count

ORDER BY Lending_Activity_Count DESC;
```

### Explanation:

- **WITH ActiveSecuritiesLending AS**: This common table expression (CTE) is used to create a temporary result set that contains the count of securities lending activities for each fund family.
- **JOIN**: We join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SECURITIES_LENDING` on `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link the fund information with its securities lending activities.
- **WHERE SL.IS_LOAN_BY_FUND = 'Y'**: This condition filters the records to include only those funds that are actively involved in securities lending.
- **GROUP BY F.SERIES_NAME**: This groups the results by fund family, identified by `SERIES_NAME`.
- **COUNT(SL.HOLDING_ID) AS Lending_Activity_Count**: This counts the number of securities lending activities for each fund family.
- **ORDER BY Lending_Activity_Count DESC**: This orders the results to show the most active fund families first.
