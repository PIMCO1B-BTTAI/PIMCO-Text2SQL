classification reasoning: To determine PIMCO's current duration positioning across their major bond funds, we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: We need to find tables that contain information about the fund's duration positioning. This might involve looking at tables that contain interest rate risk or other related metrics.

2. **Identify PIMCO's Funds**: We need to identify which funds are managed by PIMCO. This would typically involve looking at the `REGISTRANT` table to find entries where the `REGISTRANT_NAME` is PIMCO.

3. **Join Tables**: We would likely need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with other tables that contain information about the funds' duration positioning. This could involve joining with the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table or other relevant tables.

4. **Filter for Major Bond Funds**: We need to filter the results to only include PIMCO's major bond funds. This might involve additional criteria or filtering based on fund size or other attributes.

5. **Determine Duration Positioning**: We need to extract and possibly calculate the duration positioning from the relevant columns in the joined tables.

Given these steps, the query will likely involve multiple joins and possibly some calculations or aggregations to determine the duration positioning. Therefore, this query would be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves joining multiple tables but does not necessarily require nested queries.

process_thesql: ** Joins the `PIMCOFunds` CTE with the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table to retrieve the duration positioning data for each of PIMCO's major bond funds.
- **Selected Columns:** Includes `SERIES_NAME` to identify the fund and various `DV01` columns to represent the duration positioning across different maturities.
