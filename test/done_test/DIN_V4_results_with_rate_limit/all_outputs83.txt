================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Show me our best performing strategies in rising rate environments" is quite broad and doesn't directly map to specific columns or tables in the provided schema. However, if we were to interpret this in the context of the schema, we might consider looking at performance metrics like total returns or interest rate risk data.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We might consider the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table to evaluate performance.
   - The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table could provide insights into how different strategies perform under changing interest rates.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins**:
   - If we want to correlate performance with interest rate changes, we would need to join `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` with `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**:
   - If we need to filter or rank strategies based on specific criteria (e.g., top performers), we might need nested queries to first calculate or filter performance metrics before ranking them.

Given these considerations, the query would likely involve:
- A join between `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` and `INTEREST_RATE_RISK`.
- Potential nested queries to filter or rank strategies based on performance metrics.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED" due to the potential need for both joins and nested queries to fully address the question.

### Explanation:

- **InterestRiskScores CTE:** Calculates a composite risk score for each fund by summing the absolute values of the interest rate changes (DV01) across different maturities. This score helps identify funds that are sensitive to interest rate changes.
- **AverageMonthlyReturns CTE:** Computes the average monthly return for each fund over the three months in the reporting period.
- **Final Selection:** Joins the risk scores and average returns with the fund information to identify the best performing strategies. The results are ordered by average monthly return in descending order to highlight the top performers. The `LIMIT 5` clause is used to return the top 5 strategies.
