classification reasoning: To determine if any funds are taking on more risk lately by examining their borrowing trends, we need to analyze data from the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, specifically the "borrowing_pay_within_1yr" column. This column provides information on the short-term borrowing of funds, which can indicate increased risk if the borrowing amount is rising.

Since the question asks about trends, we might need to compare borrowing amounts over different periods. However, the schema provided does not include explicit time-series data or historical records for borrowing trends, so we would typically need to look at multiple records over time to assess trends.

Given the schema and the question, we would likely need to:

1. Identify funds with increasing borrowing amounts in the "borrowing_pay_within_1yr" column.
2. Compare these amounts over different reporting periods to identify trends.

This task involves analyzing data from a single table ("FUND_REPORTED_INFO") and does not require joining with other tables or using nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To address the question of identifying funds that seem to be taking on more risk lately by examining their borrowing trends, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This table contains columns related to borrowing, specifically `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR`, which indicate short-term and long-term borrowing amounts, respectively.

The task is to identify funds with increasing borrowing trends, which can be interpreted as an increase in either short-term or long-term borrowing. Since the question does not specify a time frame or a comparison with previous periods, we will assume that funds with non-zero borrowing amounts are potentially taking on more risk.

Here's the SQL query to retrieve funds with borrowing amounts:

```sql
SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER, SERIES_NAME, BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR, BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR > 0 OR BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR > 0;
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: We select `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `SERIES_NAME` to identify the funds, along with `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` and `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR` to examine their borrowing amounts.

2. **FROM Clause**: The data is sourced from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains the necessary borrowing information.

3. **WHERE Clause**: We filter the results to include only those funds where either `BORROWING_PAY_WITHIN_1YR` or `BORROWING_PAY_AFTER_1YR` is greater than zero, indicating that the fund has some level of borrowing, which could imply increased risk.

This query provides a list of funds with current borrowing, which can be a sign of increased risk if the borrowing amounts are significant or increasing over time. However, without historical data or a specific time frame, this query serves as a starting point for identifying funds with borrowing activities.
