classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most cash on hand, we need to look at the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column, which represents cash holdings or equivalents not categorized in specific asset parts. We need to identify the funds with the highest values in this column.

- The query involves only the `fund_reported_info` table.
- We don't need to join with any other tables since all necessary information is contained within this table.
- We don't need nested queries as we are simply selecting and ordering data from a single table.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To answer the question "Which funds have the most cash on hand?", we need to identify the funds with the highest cash holdings. The relevant column for cash holdings is `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. This column represents cash holdings or equivalents that haven't been categorized in specific asset parts (Parts C or D).

Given the task constraints, we should not use nested queries or join statements. Instead, we can directly query the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to find the funds with the most cash on hand.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT SERIES_NAME, CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
ORDER BY CAST(CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D AS FLOAT) DESC;
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: We select `SERIES_NAME` to identify the fund and `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` to get the cash amount.

2. **FROM Clause**: We are querying from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, which contains the necessary information about the funds and their cash holdings.

3. **ORDER BY Clause**: We order the results by `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` in descending order to list the funds with the most cash on hand at the top. We cast `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` to `FLOAT` to ensure proper numerical sorting, as the default data type might be `TEXT`.

This query will return a list of funds ordered by their cash holdings, allowing us to identify which funds have the most cash on hand.
