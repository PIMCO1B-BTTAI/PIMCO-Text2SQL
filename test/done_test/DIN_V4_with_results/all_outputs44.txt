Schema Links for Question: I need to check which funds may be too concentrated - find ones where a single holding is more than 10% of their portfolio?
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which funds have a single holding that constitutes more than 10% of their portfolio, we need to analyze the holdings of each fund and compare the percentage of each holding to the total net assets of the fund. This involves data from the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, where we can find the percentage of each holding, and the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, where we can find the net assets of the fund.

1. **Identify the Tables Involved**: 
   - "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" for the percentage of each holding.
   - "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" for the net assets of the fund.

2. **Determine the Relationships**:
   - We need to join "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" with "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" as the foreign key to relate holdings to their respective funds.

3. **Filter the Data**:
   - We need to filter the holdings where the percentage is greater than 10%.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since this requires joining two tables to relate holdings to their respective funds, it is a "NON-NESTED" query. We do not need nested queries, but we do need a join to combine data from the two tables.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
    HOLDING_ID, 
    ISSUER_NAME, 
    PERCENTAGE
FROM 
    FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING
WHERE 
    CAST(PERCENTAGE AS FLOAT) > 10;
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT Clause:** We select `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `HOLDING_ID`, `ISSUER_NAME`, and `PERCENTAGE` to provide a comprehensive view of the holdings that are more than 10% of the fund's portfolio.
- **FROM Clause:** We use the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table because it contains the necessary information about each holding's percentage of the fund's net assets.
- **WHERE Clause:** We filter the holdings where the `PERCENTAGE` is greater than 10. We cast `PERCENTAGE` to `FLOAT` to ensure accurate numerical comparison, as it might be stored as a text type.

This query will return all holdings that are more than 10% of their respective fund's portfolio, helping to identify funds that may be too concentrated.
