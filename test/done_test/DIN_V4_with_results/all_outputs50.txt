classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most foreign currency exposure, particularly in emerging markets, we need to analyze the data related to currency exposure and fund holdings. However, the provided schema does not explicitly mention a table or column that directly indicates foreign currency exposure or categorizes markets as emerging.

Given the complexity of the question, we would likely need to:

1. Identify tables that contain information about currency exposure. This might involve looking at tables with currency codes or foreign currency transactions, such as `FWD_FOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT_SWAP` or `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `CURRENCY_CODE`.

2. Determine which of these currencies are associated with emerging markets. This might require external knowledge or a predefined list of emerging market currencies.

3. Aggregate the exposure by fund to determine which funds have the most exposure to these currencies.

Since this involves multiple steps and potentially complex logic to determine emerging market currencies, it would likely require nested queries or multiple joins to gather and process the necessary data.

Therefore, the SQL query for this question would be classified as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine which funds have the most foreign currency exposure, particularly in emerging markets, we need to consider the following:

1. **Foreign Currency Exposure**: This can be identified by looking at the `CURRENCY_CODE` in the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table. Funds with multiple or significant foreign currency entries might indicate higher exposure.

2. **Emerging Markets**: We need to identify which currencies are considered emerging market currencies. This information is not directly available in the schema, so we would typically need a list of such currencies. For this example, let's assume we have a predefined list of emerging market currency codes.

3. **Fund Identification**: We need to link the foreign currency exposure back to the funds. This can be done by joining the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

4. **Aggregation and Ranking**: We need to aggregate the exposure by fund and rank them to find the ones with the most exposure.

Given these steps, we can construct the SQL query as follows:

```sql
WITH EmergingMarketCurrencies AS (
    -- Assuming these are the currency codes for emerging markets
    SELECT 'BRL' AS CURRENCY_CODE UNION
    SELECT 'INR' UNION
    SELECT 'CNY' UNION
    SELECT 'ZAR' UNION
    SELECT 'RUB'
),
ForeignCurrencyExposure AS (
    SELECT 
        IR.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT IR.CURRENCY_CODE) AS ForeignCurrencyCount
    FROM 
        INTEREST_RATE_RISK IR
    JOIN 
        EmergingMarketCurrencies EMC ON IR.CURRENCY_CODE = EMC.CURRENCY_CODE
    GROUP BY 
        IR.ACCESSION_NUMBER
),
FundExposure AS (
    SELECT 
        F.SERIES_NAME, 
        F.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        FE.ForeignCurrencyCount
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN 
        ForeignCurrencyExposure FE ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FE.ACCESSION_NUMBER
)
SELECT 
    SERIES_NAME, 
    ForeignCurrencyCount
FROM 
    FundExposure
ORDER BY 
    ForeignCurrencyCount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Explanation:

- **EmergingMarketCurrencies CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) defines a list of currency codes that are considered emerging market currencies. This is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual data.

- **ForeignCurrencyExposure CTE**: This CTE calculates the number of distinct foreign currencies (from the emerging markets list) each fund is exposed to by counting the distinct `CURRENCY_CODE` entries in the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table.

- **FundExposure CTE**: This CTE joins the `ForeignCurrencyExposure` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to get the series name of each fund along with its foreign currency exposure count.

- **Final SELECT**: The final query selects the series name and the count of foreign currencies, ordering by the count in descending order to find the funds with the most exposure. The `LIMIT 5` clause is used to return the top 5 funds.
