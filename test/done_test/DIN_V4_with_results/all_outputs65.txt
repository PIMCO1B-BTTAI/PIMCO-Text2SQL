classification reasoning: To determine the geographic distribution of international holdings, we need to analyze the data related to the country of the issuer for each holding. This information is likely found in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, specifically in the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column. 

Since the question asks for a distribution, we would typically need to group the data by country and count the number of holdings or sum their values. This operation involves only the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, as we are interested in the geographic distribution based on the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` field.

Given that this task involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To determine the geographic distribution of international holdings, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which contains information about the holdings of the fund, including the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column. This column provides the ISO country code corresponding to the country where the issuer is organized, which is crucial for understanding geographic exposure.

Given the task's constraints, we should avoid using nested queries or join statements. Therefore, we can directly query the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to get the distribution of holdings by country.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT INVESTMENT_COUNTRY, COUNT(*) AS Holding_Count
FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING
GROUP BY INVESTMENT_COUNTRY;
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` to identify the country of each holding. We also use `COUNT(*) AS Holding_Count` to count the number of holdings for each country, which gives us the distribution.

2. **FROM Clause**: We specify the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table as it contains the necessary information about the holdings and their geographic distribution.

3. **GROUP BY Clause**: We group the results by `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` to aggregate the holdings count for each country, which provides the geographic distribution of the holdings.

This query will return a list of countries along with the count of holdings in each, effectively showing the geographic distribution of the international holdings.
