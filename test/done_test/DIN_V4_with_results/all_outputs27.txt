classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Find funds with the highest quality fixed-income holdings," we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Query**: The query is asking for funds with the highest quality fixed-income holdings. This implies that we need to identify fixed-income holdings and assess their quality.

2. **Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains information about the holdings of the fund, including asset categories.
   - The `DEBT_SECURITY` table provides additional information for debt securities, which are typically fixed-income instruments. This table includes details like maturity dates, coupon types, and default statuses, which can be used to assess the quality of the holdings.

3. **Joins and Conditions**:
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `DEBT_SECURITY` to access information about fixed-income holdings.
   - We may need to filter or sort based on attributes that determine the quality of the fixed-income holdings, such as `ANNUALIZED_RATE`, `IS_DEFAULT`, or `COUPON_TYPE`.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since the query involves joining multiple tables to gather the necessary information about fixed-income holdings and their quality, it requires a JOIN operation.
   - The query does not explicitly require nested queries (e.g., using subqueries with INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN).

Based on this analysis, the query requires JOIN operations but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification: "NON-NESTED"
================================================================================
process_thesql: ** Joins the CTE with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to get the `SERIES_NAME` of the fund and orders the results by `ANNUALIZED_RATE` in descending order to list the funds with the highest quality fixed-income holdings.
- **LIMIT 10:** This limits the result to the top 10 funds with the highest quality fixed-income holdings based on the `ANNUALIZED_RATE`. Adjust the limit as needed based on the requirement.
