classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Find any funds showing losses in their realized gains," we need to identify the relevant tables and columns involved.

1. **Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - The query is concerned with funds and their realized gains. The relevant columns for realized gains are:
     - `fund_reported_info.net_realize_gain_nonderiv_mon1`
     - `monthly_return_cat_instrument.net_realized_gain_mon1`

2. **Understanding the Query**:
   - We need to find funds where the realized gains are negative, indicating a loss.

3. **Table Relationships**:
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains the `net_realize_gain_nonderiv_mon1` column.
   - The `MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT` table contains the `net_realized_gain_mon1` column.
   - There is a foreign key relationship between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

4. **Query Requirements**:
   - We need to check for negative values in the realized gains columns from potentially two different tables.
   - This requires examining data from both tables, which implies a need for a JOIN operation to combine data from these tables based on the accession number.

5. **Classification**:
   - Since the query involves a JOIN to combine data from two tables, but does not require nested queries (like subqueries or set operations), it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

    SERIES_NAME,

FROM

```

### Explanation:

- **Common Table Expression (CTE):** We use a CTE named `RealizedLosses` to encapsulate the logic of finding funds with losses in realized gains.
- **Join:** We perform a `LEFT JOIN` between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT` on `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to ensure we capture all funds, even if they don't have derivative data.
- **Filter Condition:** We filter for rows where either `NET_REALIZED_GAIN_MON1` or `NET_REALIZE_GAIN_NONDERIV_MON1` is negative, indicating a loss.
- **Select Statement:** Finally, we select the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, `SERIES_NAME`, and the realized gain columns to identify the funds and the nature of their losses.
