================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Find me funds that might be too exposed to interest rate changes - check their duration risk," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question is about interest rate exposure, which suggests looking at the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table. The columns related to interest rate changes, such as `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01`, etc., are relevant for assessing duration risk.

2. **Determine the Need for Joins**: Since the question is about funds, we might need to link the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get information about the funds. This requires a join based on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Assess the Need for Nested Queries**: The question does not specify any complex conditions that would require nested queries, such as filtering based on aggregated data or performing set operations.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve a join between `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to assess the interest rate risk for each fund. However, it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

```

### Explanation:

- **WITH Clause (CTE)**: We use a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `InterestRiskScores` to calculate the composite risk score for each fund by summing the absolute values of the DV01 metrics.
- **JOIN**: We join the CTE with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get the series name of each fund.
- **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by the composite risk score in descending order to highlight funds with the highest exposure to interest rate changes.
- **ABS and CAST**: We use `ABS` to ensure all values are positive and `CAST` to convert text to float for accurate calculations.
