classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find any funds where assets dropped despite positive sales," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: This table contains information about the fund, including total assets and sales flow.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`: This table might be relevant if we need to check specific holdings, but primarily we are interested in the overall fund information.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We need to identify funds where the total assets have decreased. This implies comparing the current total assets with a previous value, which might require a self-join or a subquery to compare different periods.
   - We also need to ensure that there were positive sales, which can be checked using the `sales_flow_mon1`, `sales_flow_mon2`, or `sales_flow_mon3` columns in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

3. **Query Complexity**:
   - Since we need to compare the total assets over different periods, this will likely require a subquery or a self-join to compare the current period's assets with a previous period's assets.
   - We also need to ensure that the sales flow is positive, which can be done with a simple condition.

Given these considerations, the query will likely involve a subquery or a self-join to compare asset values across different periods, making it a "NESTED" query.

process_thesql: To solve the problem of finding funds where assets dropped despite positive sales, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to track changes in assets and sales. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about `TOTAL_ASSETS`, which we can use to determine if assets have dropped. 
   - The `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, and `SALES_FLOW_MON3` columns in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table indicate sales for each of the three months in the reporting period.

2. **Determine Asset Changes**:
   - We need to compare the `TOTAL_ASSETS` of a fund across different reporting periods to identify a drop. This can be done using the `LAG` window function to compare the current period's assets with the previous period's assets.

3. **Check for Positive Sales**:
   - We need to ensure that sales are positive in at least one of the months. This can be checked by ensuring that at least one of the `SALES_FLOW_MON1`, `SALES_FLOW_MON2`, or `SALES_FLOW_MON3` is greater than zero.

4. **Combine Conditions**:
   - We need to find funds where the assets have decreased compared to the previous period, and there are positive sales in at least one of the months.

5. **SQL Query Construction**:
   - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the previous period's assets using the `LAG` function.
   - Filter the results to find funds where the current period's assets are less than the previous period's assets and where there is a positive sales flow in any of the three months.

Here is the SQL query that implements the above logic:

```sql
WITH AssetChanges AS (
    SELECT 
        F.ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
        F.SERIES_NAME, 
        S.REPORT_DATE, 
        F.TOTAL_ASSETS,
        LAG(F.TOTAL_ASSETS) OVER (PARTITION BY F.SERIES_NAME ORDER BY S.REPORT_DATE) AS Previous_Period_Assets,
        F.SALES_FLOW_MON1,
        F.SALES_FLOW_MON2,
        F.SALES_FLOW_MON3
    FROM 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN 
        SUBMISSION S ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = S.ACCESSION_NUMBER
)
SELECT DISTINCT 
    AC.SERIES_NAME
FROM 
    AssetChanges AC
WHERE 
    AC.TOTAL_ASSETS < AC.Previous_Period_Assets
    AND (AC.SALES_FLOW_MON1 > 0 OR AC.SALES_FLOW_MON2 > 0 OR AC.SALES_FLOW_MON3 > 0)
    AND AC.Previous_Period_Assets IS NOT NULL;
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE (AssetChanges)**: This CTE calculates the previous period's assets using the `LAG` function and retrieves sales data for each month.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters funds where the current period's assets are less than the previous period's assets and there is a positive sales flow in any of the three months.
- **DISTINCT**: Ensures that each fund is listed only once, even if multiple conditions are met across different periods.
