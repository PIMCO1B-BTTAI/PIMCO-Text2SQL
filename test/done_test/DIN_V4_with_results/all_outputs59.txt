classification reasoning: The question "Find funds with unusual monthly return patterns - looking for potential outliers" involves analyzing the monthly return data to identify outliers. This task requires examining the "monthly_total_return" table to assess the monthly returns for potential outliers. 

To identify outliers, we might need to perform statistical analysis or comparisons, which could involve complex calculations or subqueries. However, the primary task is to analyze data from a single table, "monthly_total_return," without needing to join it with other tables.

Since the task involves analyzing data from a single table without requiring joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To find funds with unusual monthly return patterns, we need to identify potential outliers in the monthly total returns. The `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table contains the monthly return data for funds, which is crucial for this task. We will calculate the average return for each fund over the three months and then determine the standard deviation to identify outliers. Funds with a high standard deviation in their returns can be considered to have unusual patterns.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH FundReturns AS (
    SELECT 
        ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        (CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) + 
         CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) + 
         CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT)) / 3.0 AS Avg_Return,
        (CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT) - 
         CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT)) AS Return_Diff1,
        (CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 AS FLOAT) - 
         CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT)) AS Return_Diff2,
        (CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 AS FLOAT) - 
         CAST(MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 AS FLOAT)) AS Return_Diff3
    FROM 
        MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN
),
ReturnVariability AS (
    SELECT 
        ACCESSION_NUMBER,
        Avg_Return,
        (ABS(Return_Diff1) + ABS(Return_Diff2) + ABS(Return_Diff3)) / 3.0 AS Avg_Variability
    FROM 
        FundReturns
)
SELECT 
    ACCESSION_NUMBER, 
    Avg_Return, 
    Avg_Variability
FROM 
    ReturnVariability
WHERE 
    Avg_Variability > (SELECT AVG(Avg_Variability) + 2 * STDDEV(Avg_Variability) FROM ReturnVariability)
ORDER BY 
    Avg_Variability DESC;
```

### Explanation:

1. **FundReturns CTE**: This common table expression calculates the average return for each fund over the three months and the differences between consecutive monthly returns. These differences help in assessing the variability in returns.

2. **ReturnVariability CTE**: This CTE calculates the average variability of returns for each fund by taking the average of the absolute differences between consecutive monthly returns.

3. **Main Query**: The main query selects funds with an average variability greater than two standard deviations above the mean variability, which are considered potential outliers. This is a common statistical method to identify outliers.

4. **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by `Avg_Variability` in descending order to list the funds with the most unusual return patterns at the top.
