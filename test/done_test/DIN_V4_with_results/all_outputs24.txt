classification reasoning: To determine if funds are taking on too much credit risk by examining their non-investment grade holdings, we need to analyze data from the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically focusing on the credit spread columns related to non-investment grade holdings. The relevant columns for this analysis are:

- `fund_reported_info.credit_spread_3mon_noninvest`
- `fund_reported_info.credit_spread_1yr_noninvest`
- `fund_reported_info.credit_spread_5yr_noninvest`
- `fund_reported_info.credit_spread_10yr_noninvest`
- `fund_reported_info.credit_spread_30yr_noninvest`

These columns provide insights into the change in value of the portfolio resulting from a 1 basis point change in credit spreads for non-investment grade holdings across different maturities.

Since the question is about identifying funds with potentially high credit risk based on their non-investment grade holdings, we only need to query the `fund_reported_info` table. There is no need to join with other tables or use nested queries, as we are focusing on a single table and specific columns within it.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection of data from a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER, SERIES_NAME
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO
WHERE CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
   OR CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
   OR CREDIT_SPREAD_5YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
   OR CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL
   OR CREDIT_SPREAD_30YR_NONINVEST IS NOT NULL;
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Nested Queries**: The task specifies that nested queries or join statements should not be used. Therefore, the query is structured as a simple `SELECT` statement with conditions applied directly.

2. **Mapping Columns to Query**: The question asks for funds with non-investment grade holdings, which are indicated by the columns `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_NONINVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_NONINVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_5YR_NONINVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_10YR_NONINVEST`, and `CREDIT_SPREAD_30YR_NONINVEST` in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. These columns represent the credit spread changes for non-investment grade holdings over different maturities.

3. **Query Structure**:
   - **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `SERIES_NAME` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. These columns identify the fund and its series name.
   - **WHERE Clause**: Checks if any of the non-investment grade credit spread columns are not null. This indicates that the fund has non-investment grade holdings, which might suggest higher credit risk.

4. **No Aggregation or Grouping**: The query does not require aggregation or grouping since the task is to identify funds with specific characteristics rather than perform calculations or summarize data.

5. **No Ordering or Limiting**: The task does not specify any need for ordering or limiting the results, so these clauses are not included.
