classification reasoning: To determine if a fund has strong and consistent returns over all three months, we need to analyze the monthly total returns for each fund. This involves checking the returns for each of the three months and ensuring they meet a certain threshold or consistency criteria.

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need data from the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, specifically the columns `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`.

2. **Determine the Criteria for "Strong and Consistent Returns"**:
   - The question does not specify what constitutes "strong and consistent returns," so we would need to define this. For example, we might consider returns above a certain percentage as strong and require that all three months meet this threshold for consistency.

3. **Formulate the Query**:
   - We would select funds where all three monthly returns meet the defined criteria. This can be done with a simple query that checks each of the three return columns against the threshold.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since the query involves only one table (`MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN`) and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER
FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN
WHERE MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 > 0
  AND MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 > 0
  AND MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3 > 0;
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER**: We select the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to identify the funds.
- **FROM MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN**: We are querying the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table.
- **WHERE Clause**: We filter the results to include only those funds where all three monthly returns (`MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3`) are greater than zero, indicating strong and consistent returns across all three months.
