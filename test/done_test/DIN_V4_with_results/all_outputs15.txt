classification reasoning: The question "Which registrants have multiple phone numbers?" requires us to identify registrants with more than one phone number. This involves checking the "registrant" table for duplicate entries based on the "registrant_name" or "cik" with different "phone" numbers. 

To achieve this, we need to group the data by "registrant_name" or "cik" and count the number of distinct phone numbers for each group. If the count is greater than one, it indicates multiple phone numbers. This operation can be done using a GROUP BY clause and a HAVING clause in SQL.

Since this operation involves only the "registrant" table and does not require any nested queries or joins with other tables, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

process_thesql: To determine which registrants have multiple phone numbers, we need to identify registrants with more than one distinct phone number in the `REGISTRANT` table. This can be achieved by grouping the data by `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and counting the distinct phone numbers for each group. If the count is greater than one, it indicates that the registrant has multiple phone numbers.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT REGISTRANT_NAME
FROM REGISTRANT
GROUP BY ACCESSION_NUMBER, REGISTRANT_NAME
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT PHONE) > 1;
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT REGISTRANT_NAME**: We want to retrieve the names of the registrants who have multiple phone numbers.

2. **FROM REGISTRANT**: We are querying the `REGISTRANT` table, which contains the phone numbers and registrant details.

3. **GROUP BY ACCESSION_NUMBER, REGISTRANT_NAME**: We group the results by `ACCESSION_NUMBER` and `REGISTRANT_NAME` to ensure that we are counting phone numbers for each unique registrant.

4. **HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT PHONE) > 1**: This condition filters the groups to only include those where the count of distinct phone numbers is greater than one, indicating multiple phone numbers for the registrant.
