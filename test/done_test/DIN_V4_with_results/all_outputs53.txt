classification reasoning: To determine which investment companies are most exposed to international markets, we need to analyze the data related to the geographic exposure of their holdings. This involves examining the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, specifically the "investment_country" column, to identify holdings in countries outside the domestic market.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We need to look at the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table to get information about the holdings and their respective countries.
   - The "REGISTRANT" table can be used to identify the investment companies (registrants) by their names and CIKs.

2. **Determine Exposure**:
   - We need to calculate the exposure of each investment company to international markets. This can be done by counting or summing the holdings that are in non-domestic countries.

3. **Join Tables**:
   - We need to join the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table with the "REGISTRANT" table using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" to link holdings to their respective registrants.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since this involves joining two tables and possibly aggregating data to determine exposure, it requires a JOIN but not necessarily a nested query. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To determine which investment companies are most exposed to international markets, we need to focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, specifically the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column. This column indicates the country where the issuer is organized, which helps us understand the geographic exposure of the fund's holdings.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - We need the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to access the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` column.
   - We also need the `REGISTRANT` table to get the names of the investment companies (`REGISTRANT_NAME`).

2. **Join Tables:**
   - Join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `REGISTRANT` using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the foreign key to link the holdings to the investment companies.

3. **Filter for International Exposure:**
   - We assume that international exposure means holdings in countries other than the company's home country. However, since we don't have the home country information in the provided schema, we'll consider all non-null `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` entries as international exposure.

4. **Aggregate and Sort:**
   - Count the number of international holdings for each investment company.
   - Sort the results to find the companies with the most international holdings.

5. **SQL Query Construction:**
   - Use a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate the data by `REGISTRANT_NAME`.
   - Use `COUNT` to determine the number of international holdings for each company.
   - Use `ORDER BY` to sort the companies by their international exposure in descending order.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH InternationalExposure AS (
    SELECT R.REGISTRANT_NAME, COUNT(FRH.HOLDING_ID) AS International_Holdings
    FROM FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH
    JOIN REGISTRANT R ON FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER = R.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE FRH.INVESTMENT_COUNTRY IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY R.REGISTRANT_NAME
)
SELECT REGISTRANT_NAME, International_Holdings
FROM InternationalExposure
ORDER BY International_Holdings DESC;
```

### Explanation:

- **CTE (Common Table Expression):** `InternationalExposure` is used to calculate the number of international holdings for each investment company.
- **JOIN:** We join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `REGISTRANT` to link holdings to their respective companies.
- **WHERE Clause:** Filters out entries where `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY` is null, assuming these are not international.
- **GROUP BY:** Aggregates the data by `REGISTRANT_NAME` to count the number of international holdings.
- **ORDER BY:** Sorts the results to show companies with the most international exposure at the top.
