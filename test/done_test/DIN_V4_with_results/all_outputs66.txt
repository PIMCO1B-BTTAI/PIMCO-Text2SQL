classification reasoning: To analyze bond maturity distribution across credit ratings, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: We need information about bond maturities and credit ratings. The `DEBT_SECURITY` table provides maturity dates, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains credit spread information, which can be used to infer credit ratings.

2. **Joins Required**: We need to join the `DEBT_SECURITY` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table using the `HOLDING_ID` to get the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`. Then, we can join with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to access credit spread information.

3. **Query Complexity**: The query requires joining multiple tables to gather the necessary data, but it does not require nested queries. We are simply aggregating and analyzing data across joined tables.

Based on the need for joins but not nested queries, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: To analyze the bond maturity distribution across credit ratings, we need to consider the relevant tables and columns that can provide information about bond maturities and credit ratings. Based on the provided schema, the `DEBT_SECURITY` table contains the `maturity_date` for bonds, and the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains credit spread information, which can be used as a proxy for credit ratings.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - `DEBT_SECURITY`: This table contains the `maturity_date` for each bond.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: This table contains credit spread information, which can be used to infer credit ratings.

2. **Join Tables:**
   - We need to join `DEBT_SECURITY` with `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` using `HOLDING_ID` to link the bond information with the fund's reported holdings.
   - Then, join `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` with `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` using `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link the holdings with credit spread information.

3. **Group and Aggregate Data:**
   - Group the data by credit rating (inferred from credit spread columns) and maturity date.
   - Count the number of bonds for each combination of credit rating and maturity date to analyze the distribution.

4. **SQL Query Construction:**
   - Use `GROUP BY` to categorize the bonds by inferred credit ratings and maturity dates.
   - Use `COUNT()` to determine the number of bonds in each category.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH BondMaturityDistribution AS (
    SELECT 
        DS.maturity_date,
        CASE 
            WHEN FRI.CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_INVERT IS NOT NULL THEN 'Investment Grade'
            ELSE 'Non-Investment Grade'
        END AS Credit_Rating
    FROM 
        DEBT_SECURITY DS
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH ON DS.HOLDING_ID = FRH.HOLDING_ID
    JOIN 
        FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI ON FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER
)
SELECT 
    Credit_Rating, 
    maturity_date, 
    COUNT(*) AS Bond_Count
FROM 
    BondMaturityDistribution
GROUP BY 
    Credit_Rating, 
    maturity_date
ORDER BY 
    Credit_Rating, 
    maturity_date;
```

### Explanation:

- **Common Table Expression (CTE):** `BondMaturityDistribution` is used to simplify the query by first selecting the necessary columns and performing the join operations.
- **CASE Statement:** Used to categorize bonds into 'Investment Grade' or 'Non-Investment Grade' based on the presence of credit spread data.
- **GROUP BY:** Groups the results by `Credit_Rating` and `maturity_date` to analyze the distribution.
- **COUNT():** Counts the number of bonds in each group to provide the distribution analysis.
- **ORDER BY:** Orders the results by `Credit_Rating` and `maturity_date` for better readability.
