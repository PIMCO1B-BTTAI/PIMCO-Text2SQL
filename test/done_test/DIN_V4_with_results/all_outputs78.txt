classification reasoning: The question "How do PIMCO's bond funds compare to their equity funds in terms of growth?" requires analyzing data related to PIMCO's bond and equity funds and comparing their growth. To answer this, we would need to:

1. Identify PIMCO's funds, which involves filtering by the registrant name in the "REGISTRANT" table.
2. Determine which funds are bond funds and which are equity funds. This might involve looking at the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to categorize funds based on their series name or another relevant attribute.
3. Assess the growth of these funds, which could involve examining the "MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN" table to analyze the total returns over a period.

This process involves joining multiple tables to gather the necessary data and potentially using nested queries to perform the comparison of growth between bond and equity funds. Therefore, the SQL query for this question would require both JOIN operations and possibly nested queries to perform the comparison, classifying it as "NESTED."

process_thesql: To address the question "How do PIMCO's bond funds compare to their equity funds in terms of growth?", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify PIMCO Funds**: We need to filter the funds that belong to PIMCO. This can be done by checking the `REGISTRANT_NAME` in the `REGISTRANT` table for "PIMCO".

2. **Differentiate Between Bond and Equity Funds**: We need to categorize the funds into bond and equity funds. This can be done using the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, where we can identify holdings categorized as "bonds" or "equities".

3. **Calculate Growth**: Growth can be measured using the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table, which provides monthly returns. We can calculate the average or total return over a period to assess growth.

4. **Compare Growth**: Finally, we compare the growth of bond funds versus equity funds.

Here's how we can structure the SQL query:

```sql
WITH PIMCOFunds AS (
    SELECT F.ACCESSION_NUMBER, F.SERIES_NAME
    FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO F
    JOIN REGISTRANT R ON F.ACCESSION_NUMBER = R.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE R.REGISTRANT_NAME LIKE '%PIMCO%'
),
BondFunds AS (
    SELECT PF.ACCESSION_NUMBER, PF.SERIES_NAME
    FROM PIMCOFunds PF
    JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH ON PF.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE FRH.ASSET_CAT = 'bonds'
),
EquityFunds AS (
    SELECT PF.ACCESSION_NUMBER, PF.SERIES_NAME
    FROM PIMCOFunds PF
    JOIN FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING FRH ON PF.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FRH.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    WHERE FRH.ASSET_CAT = 'equities'
),
BondGrowth AS (
    SELECT BF.SERIES_NAME, AVG((MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 + MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 + MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3) / 3.0) AS Avg_Bond_Return
    FROM BondFunds BF
    JOIN MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN MTR ON BF.ACCESSION_NUMBER = MTR.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    GROUP BY BF.SERIES_NAME
),
EquityGrowth AS (
    SELECT EF.SERIES_NAME, AVG((MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1 + MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2 + MTR.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3) / 3.0) AS Avg_Equity_Return
    FROM EquityFunds EF
    JOIN MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN MTR ON EF.ACCESSION_NUMBER = MTR.ACCESSION_NUMBER
    GROUP BY EF.SERIES_NAME
)
SELECT 'Bond Funds' AS Fund_Type, AVG(Avg_Bond_Return) AS Average_Growth
FROM BondGrowth
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Equity Funds' AS Fund_Type, AVG(Avg_Equity_Return) AS Average_Growth
FROM EquityGrowth;
```

### Explanation:

- **PIMCOFunds CTE**: Filters funds associated with PIMCO using the `REGISTRANT` table.
- **BondFunds and EquityFunds CTEs**: Categorize PIMCO funds into bond and equity funds based on the `ASSET_CAT` in `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`.
- **BondGrowth and EquityGrowth CTEs**: Calculate the average monthly return for each bond and equity fund using the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table.
- **Final SELECT**: Compares the average growth of bond funds and equity funds by calculating the average of their respective returns.
