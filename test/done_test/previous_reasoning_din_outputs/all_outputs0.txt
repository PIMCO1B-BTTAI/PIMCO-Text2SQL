================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most cash on hand, we need to look at the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column, which represents cash holdings or equivalents not categorized in specific asset parts. We need to identify the funds with the highest values in this column.

1. **Identify the Table**: The relevant table is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, as it contains the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column.

2. **Determine the Columns Needed**: We need the `SERIES_NAME` to identify the fund and `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` to determine the amount of cash on hand.

3. **Order the Results**: To find the funds with the most cash, we need to sort the results by `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` in descending order.

4. **No Joins Required**: Since all the necessary information is contained within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, no joins are needed.

5. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query does not require joins or nested queries. Therefore, it can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which registrants have multiple phone numbers, we need to identify registrants with more than one distinct phone number entry. This involves checking the "registrant" table for duplicate entries based on the "registrant_name" or "accession_number" with different "phone" values.

1. **Identify the Table**: The relevant table for this query is "registrant" because it contains the phone numbers and registrant details.

2. **Determine the Need for JOIN**: Since all the required information is within the "registrant" table, there is no need for a JOIN.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: To find registrants with multiple phone numbers, we need to group the data by "registrant_name" or "accession_number" and count the distinct phone numbers. If the count is greater than one, it indicates multiple phone numbers. This can be achieved using a GROUP BY clause with a HAVING condition, which does not require a nested query.

Since the query involves only one table and does not require nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question asks for equity-focused funds. We need to identify which table contains information about the fund's focus or category. The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table has an `ASSET_CAT` column that categorizes the asset type of the holding, which could potentially indicate if a fund is equity-focused.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: If the information about whether a fund is equity-focused is contained within a single table, we do not need to perform any JOIN operations. In this case, if `ASSET_CAT` in `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` directly indicates equity-focused funds, we can filter based on this column.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: If the query requires filtering or aggregating data across multiple tables or involves complex conditions that cannot be handled by simple filtering, it might require nested queries. However, if the information is straightforward and contained within a single table, nested queries are not necessary.

Given these considerations, if the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table can be used to directly filter for equity-focused funds, the query would not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "I'm looking for any funds with 'sustainable' or 'ESG' in their name what's their total AUM?" requires us to find funds with specific keywords in their names and then calculate their total assets under management (AUM). 

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table because it contains the `SERIES_NAME` column, which likely holds the fund names.
   - We also need the `TOTAL_ASSETS` column from the same table to calculate the total AUM.

2. **Filter Condition**:
   - We need to filter the `SERIES_NAME` for entries containing the keywords 'sustainable' or 'ESG'.

3. **Aggregation**:
   - We need to sum the `TOTAL_ASSETS` for the filtered entries to get the total AUM.

4. **Join Consideration**:
   - Since all required information is within the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, no JOIN is necessary.

5. **Nested Query Consideration**:
   - The query does not require nested queries as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, it can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Could you check which states have the most fund registrants? Top 5 is fine," we need to determine the number of registrants per state and then find the top 5 states with the most registrants. This involves:

1. Accessing the "registrant" table to count the number of registrants per state.
2. Grouping the results by the "state" column.
3. Ordering the results by the count in descending order to get the states with the most registrants.
4. Limiting the results to the top 5.

This process requires a JOIN operation because we are only using the "registrant" table and performing aggregation and sorting operations. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the question "Find me funds that might be taking on too much credit risk - look at their non-investment grade holdings," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to look at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the columns related to credit spread changes for non-investment grade holdings, such as `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_NONINVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_NONINVEST`, etc.

2. **Determine the Criteria for Excessive Credit Risk**:
   - The question implies that we need to identify funds with significant exposure to non-investment grade holdings. This could be determined by examining the values in the credit spread columns for non-investment grade investments.

3. **Join Requirements**:
   - We need to identify the funds, which means we might need to join with the `REGISTRANT` table to get the fund names or identifiers if required.

4. **Classification**:
   - Since we need to analyze data from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table and potentially join with the `REGISTRANT` table to get more details about the funds, this requires a JOIN operation.
   - However, it does not require nested queries as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query would require a JOIN but not a nested query. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

classification reasoning: To address the question "Find me funds that might be taking on too much credit risk - look at their non-investment grade holdings," we need to identify funds with significant non-investment grade holdings. This involves examining the credit spread data for non-investment grade investments, which is found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. Specifically, we would look at columns like `CREDIT_SPREAD_3MON_NONINVEST`, `CREDIT_SPREAD_1YR_NONINVEST`, etc., to assess the extent of non-investment grade exposure.

Since the question does not specify any additional criteria or require data from multiple tables, we can focus on the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table alone. This means we do not need to perform any JOIN operations with other tables. Additionally, there is no indication that a nested query is necessary, as we are simply retrieving data based on a specific condition within a single table.

Therefore, the SQL query for this question would not require JOINs or nested queries, and it can be classified as "EASY."

classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with net assets over 1 billion dollars" needs these tables = [fund_reported_info], specifically the column [fund_reported_info.net_assets]. Since we are only interested in funds with net assets over 1 billion dollars, we can directly filter on this column without needing to join with any other tables. Additionally, this query does not require any nested queries, as it involves a straightforward filtering condition. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

classification reasoning: To determine which asset categories have the highest total investment value, we need to aggregate data based on asset categories and calculate the total investment value for each category. This involves using the `fund_reported_holding` table to access the `asset_cat` and `currency_value` columns. We will need to group the data by `asset_cat` and sum the `currency_value` to get the total investment value for each category.

Since this operation involves aggregating data and grouping by a specific column, it requires a JOIN between the `fund_reported_holding` table and potentially other tables if additional information is needed. However, based on the schema provided, the primary focus is on the `fund_reported_holding` table.

This query does not require nested queries, as it can be accomplished with a straightforward aggregation and grouping operation. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have assets between 100M and 500M?" requires us to identify funds based on their asset values. The relevant table for this query is "FUND_REPORTED_INFO," which contains the "TOTAL_ASSETS" column. 

1. **Identify the Table**: The "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table is needed because it contains information about the total assets of the funds.

2. **Filter Condition**: We need to filter the funds where the "TOTAL_ASSETS" are between 100 million and 500 million.

3. **No JOIN Required**: Since all the necessary information is contained within the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, there is no need to join with any other table.

4. **No Nested Query Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. It is a straightforward filter operation.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, it can be classified as "EASY."

classification reasoning: To determine which funds have the most cash on hand, we need to look at the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column, which represents cash holdings or equivalents not categorized in specific asset parts. We need to identify the funds with the highest values in this column.

1. **Identify the Table**: The relevant table is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, as it contains the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column.

2. **Determine the Required Columns**: We need to retrieve the `SERIES_NAME` or `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to identify the funds, along with the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` value to determine the amount of cash on hand.

3. **Order the Results**: To find the funds with the most cash, we need to sort the results by `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` in descending order.

4. **No Joins or Nested Queries Needed**: This query only involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection and ordering operation on a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.

================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The query is asking for equity-focused funds. This likely involves identifying funds based on their asset category or investment focus. The relevant table for this information would be `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`, specifically the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since the query is focused on identifying funds based on their asset category, it primarily involves a single table (`FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING`). There is no indication that information from multiple tables needs to be combined, so a JOIN is not necessary.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not require any complex filtering or aggregation that would necessitate a nested query. It is a straightforward selection based on a specific condition (asset category being equity).

Given these considerations, the query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, it can be classified as "EASY."
