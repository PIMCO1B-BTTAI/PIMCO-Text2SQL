thought should build on the previous ones and thoughts \\nshould progressively cover the nuances of the problem at hand.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFirst set of thoughts should be on whether a the query requires \\nCommon Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the\\nresults for sub queries. \\n\\nPrefer using Common Table Expressions rather than\\ncase when statements or nested subqueries.\\n\\nIf CTEs are required then for each CTE, an analysis of the purpose of each\\nCTE should be done.\\nAn overall structure should be outlined as to what will be calculated in \\neach CTE.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNext set of thoughts should on \\nextracting out the names of as many of \\nthe relevant columns as possible for all CTEs and for all the sql clauses such as the \\n`select`, `where` and `group_by` clauses.\\nThere might be additions or deletions from this list based on the \\nfollowing additional thoughts to be generated.\\n```\\n\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to figure out the possible phrases in the query \\nwhich can be used as values of the columns present in the table so as to use them \\nin the `where` clause.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to compare these extracted values with the list of possible values\\nof columns listed in the information for the columns so as to use the exact string\\nin the `where` clause.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to reason whether `IS_TOP_TIER_ENTITY` flag is required or not.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to figure out which time period is being queried.\\nIf nothing is specified use `PERIOD_ID = 2023Y`.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to figure out if a group_by clause is required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nThe above thoughts about \\n1. phrases for values of columns\\n2. query phrase to column value mapping\\n3. filters such as `ASSET_CAT` and others in the where clause\\n4. Period_id value to use\\n5. Group by column\\n\\nshould be generated for each of the CTE separately.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nIf the input question is similar to any of the examples given above,\\nthen a thought should be generated to detect that and then that example \\nshould be followed closely to get the SQL for the input question given.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nClosing Thoughts and Observations\\n```\\nThese should summarize:\\n1. The structure of the SQL query:\\n    - This states whether the query has any nested query.\\n    If so, the structure of the nested query is also mentioned.\\n    If not, a summary of the function of each of the select`, `where`, `group_by` etc. clauses\\n    should be mentioned.\\n2. An explanation of how the query solves the user question.\\n\\n\\nREASONING INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n```\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\nFor example, if there is a `group_by`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any sum() or any other function used it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFormat the generated sql with proper indentation - the columns in the\\n(`select` statement should have more indentation than keyword `select`\\nand so on for each SQL clause.)\\n```\\n\\n\\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\\nThe response must be a valid JSON object exactly matching this schema:\\n{\"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_nlp_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The original natural language query to be translated into SQL\"}, \"reasonings\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A thought about the user\\'s question\"}, \"helpful\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"description\": \"Whether the thought is helpful to solving the user\\'s question\"}}}, \"description\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process for query generation\"}, \"generated_sql_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The final SQL query that answers the natural language question\"}}}\\n\\nExample of properly formatted response:\\n{\\n  \"user_nlp_query\": \"Show me the top 20 largest funds by total assets\",\\n  \"reasonings\": [\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"First, we need to identify the main tables required\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"generated_sql_query\": \"SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\"\\n}\\n\\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS:\\n1.

The structure of the SQL query:\\n    - This states whether the query has any nested query.\\n    If so, the structure of the nested query is also mentioned.\\n    If not, a summary of the function of each of the select`, `where`, `group_by` etc. clauses\\n    should be mentioned.\\n2. An explanation of how the query solves the user question.\\n\\n\\nREASONING INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n```\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\nFor example, if there is a `group_by`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any sum() or any other function used it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFormat the generated sql with proper indentation - the columns in the\\n(`select` statement should have more indentation than keyword `select`\\nand so on for each SQL clause.)\\n```\\n\\n\\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\\nThe response must be a valid JSON object exactly matching this schema:\\n{\"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_nlp_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The original natural language query to be translated into SQL\"}, \"reasonings\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A thought about the user\\'s question\"}, \"helpful\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"description\": \"Whether the thought is helpful to solving the user\\'s question\"}}}, \"description\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process for query generation\"}, \"generated_sql_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The final SQL query that answers the natural language question\"}}}\\n\\nExample of properly formatted response:\\n{\\n  \"user_nlp_query\": \"List all funds with net assets over 1 billion dollars\",\\n  \"reasonings\": [\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"First, we need to identify the main tables required\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"generated_sql_query\": \"SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\"\\n}\\n\\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS:\\n1.

Period_id value to use\\n5. Group by column\\n\\nshould be generated for each of the CTE separately.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nIf the input question is similar to any of the examples given above,\\nthen a thought should be generated to detect that and then that example \\nshould be followed closely to get the SQL for the input question given.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nClosing Thoughts and Observations\\n```\\nThese should summarize:\\n1. The structure of the SQL query:\\n    - This states whether the query has any nested query.\\n    If so, the structure of the nested query is also mentioned.\\n    If not, a summary of the function of each of the select`, `where`, `group_by` etc. clauses\\n    should be mentioned.\\n2. An explanation of how the query solves the user question.\\n\\n\\nREASONING INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n```\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\nFor example, if there is a `group_by`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any sum() or any other function used it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFormat the generated sql with proper indentation - the columns in the\\n(`select` statement should have more indentation than keyword `select`\\nand so on for each SQL clause.)\\n```\\n\\n\\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\\nThe response must be a valid JSON object exactly matching this schema:\\n{\"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_nlp_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The original natural language query to be translated into SQL\"}, \"reasonings\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A thought about the user\\'s question\"}, \"helpful\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"description\": \"Whether the thought is helpful to solving the user\\'s question\"}}}, \"description\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process for query generation\"}, \"generated_sql_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The final SQL query that answers the natural language question\"}}}\\n\\nExample of properly formatted response:\\n{\\n  \"user_nlp_query\": \"Which asset categories have the highest total investment value?\",\\n  \"reasonings\": [\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"First, we need to identify the main tables required\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"generated_sql_query\": \"SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\"\\n}\\n\\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS:\\n1.

Period_id value to use\\n5. Group by column\\n\\nshould be generated for each of the CTE separately.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nIf the input question is similar to any of the examples given above,\\nthen a thought should be generated to detect that and then that example \\nshould be followed closely to get the SQL for the input question given.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nClosing Thoughts and Observations\\n```\\nThese should summarize:\\n1. The structure of the SQL query:\\n    - This states whether the query has any nested query.\\n    If so, the structure of the nested query is also mentioned.\\n    If not, a summary of the function of each of the select`, `where`, `group_by` etc. clauses\\n    should be mentioned.\\n2. An explanation of how the query solves the user question.\\n\\n\\nREASONING INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n```\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\nFor example, if there is a `group_by`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any sum() or any other function used it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFormat the generated sql with proper indentation - the columns in the\\n(`select` statement should have more indentation than keyword `select`\\nand so on for each SQL clause.)\\n```\\n\\n\\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\\nThe response must be a valid JSON object exactly matching this schema:\\n{\"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_nlp_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The original natural language query to be translated into SQL\"}, \"reasonings\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A thought about the user\\'s question\"}, \"helpful\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"description\": \"Whether the thought is helpful to solving the user\\'s question\"}}}, \"description\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process for query generation\"}, \"generated_sql_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The final SQL query that answers the natural language question\"}}}\\n\\nExample of properly formatted response:\\n{\\n  \"user_nlp_query\": \"Which funds have total assets equal to net assets?\",\\n  \"reasonings\": [\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"First, we need to identify the main tables required\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"generated_sql_query\": \"SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\"\\n}\\n\\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS:\\n1.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\nFor example, if there is a `group_by`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

increasing complexity.\\nEach thought should build on the previous ones and thoughts \\nshould progressively cover the nuances of the problem at hand.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFirst set of thoughts should be on whether a the query requires \\nCommon Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the\\nresults for sub queries. \\n\\nPrefer using Common Table Expressions rather than\\ncase when statements or nested subqueries.\\n\\nIf CTEs are required then for each CTE, an analysis of the purpose of each\\nCTE should be done.\\nAn overall structure should be outlined as to what will be calculated in \\neach CTE.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNext set of thoughts should on \\nextracting out the names of as many of \\nthe relevant columns as possible for all CTEs and for all the sql clauses such as the \\n`select`, `where` and `group_by` clauses.\\nThere might be additions or deletions from this list based on the \\nfollowing additional thoughts to be generated.\\n```\\n\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to figure out the possible phrases in the query \\nwhich can be used as values of the columns present in the table so as to use them \\nin the `where` clause.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to compare these extracted values with the list of possible values\\nof columns listed in the information for the columns so as to use the exact string\\nin the `where` clause.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to reason whether `IS_TOP_TIER_ENTITY` flag is required or not.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to figure out which time period is being queried.\\nIf nothing is specified use `PERIOD_ID = 2023Y`.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nGenerate a thought to figure out if a group_by clause is required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nThe above thoughts about \\n1. phrases for values of columns\\n2. query phrase to column value mapping\\n3. filters such as `ASSET_CAT` and others in the where clause\\n4. Period_id value to use\\n5. Group by column\\n\\nshould be generated for each of the CTE separately.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nIf the input question is similar to any of the examples given above,\\nthen a thought should be generated to detect that and then that example \\nshould be followed closely to get the SQL for the input question given.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nClosing Thoughts and Observations\\n```\\nThese should summarize:\\n1. The structure of the SQL query:\\n    - This states whether the query has any nested query.\\n    If so, the structure of the nested query is also mentioned.\\n    If not, a summary of the function of each of the select`, `where`, `group_by` etc. clauses\\n    should be mentioned.\\n2. An explanation of how the query solves the user question.\\n\\n\\nREASONING INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n```\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\nFor example, if there is a `group_by`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any sum() or any other function used it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nFormat the generated sql with proper indentation - the columns in the\\n(`select` statement should have more indentation than keyword `select`\\nand so on for each SQL clause.)\\n```\\n\\n\\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\\nThe response must be a valid JSON object exactly matching this schema:\\n{\"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"user_nlp_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The original natural language query to be translated into SQL\"}, \"reasonings\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A thought about the user\\'s question\"}, \"helpful\": {\"type\": \"boolean\", \"description\": \"Whether the thought is helpful to solving the user\\'s question\"}}}, \"description\": \"Step-by-step reasoning process for query generation\"}, \"generated_sql_query\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The final SQL query that answers the natural language question\"}}}\\n\\nExample of properly formatted response:\\n{\\n  \"user_nlp_query\": \"Which funds have the highest liabilities to assets ratio?\",\\n  \"reasonings\": [\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"First, we need to identify the main tables required\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"thought\": \"Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause\",\\n      \"helpful\": true\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"generated_sql_query\": \"SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\"\\n}\\n\\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS:\\n1. Provide 3-5 thoughts explaining your strategy\\n2. Each thought should explain WHY you\\'re taking an approach\\n3. Focus on query planning, not implementation details\\n4. Consider table relationships and data types\\n\\nQUERY COMPLEXITY LEVEL: \"EASY\"\\n\\nRESTRICTIONS: Both JOINs and nested queries allowed if needed.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Return only valid JSON with no additional text.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",
