Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Top 5 is fine.\\n    ```\\n    \\n```\\nTask Description:\\nThe task is to transform the natural language query into a SQL query for SQLite database.\\nThis involves parsing the intent of the query and understanding the structure of the data to generate an appropriate SQL command.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDatabase Overview:\\n- The Database combines information from 30 tables of the NPORT dataset from quarter 4 of 2019 to quarter 3 of 2024.\\n- The data includes a comprehensive view of fund-level information, holdings, debt securities, repurchase agreements, and derivative instruments.\\n- Each relation represents detailed information about financial transactions, security holdings, and fund performance, including key identifiers like ACCESSION_NUMBER, HOLDING_ID, and CUSIP for borrowers, holdings, and securities.\\n- The table provides essential metrics like total assets, liabilities, interest rate risks, monthly returns, and details for securities lending and collateral.\\n- The table aggregates all the data to provide a holistic view of financial activities for the 2019q4 to 2024q3 period.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNatural Language Processing Instructions:\\n- Decompose the user\\'s query to identify requirements regarding asset classes, sectors, time periods, or specific filings.\\n- Detect keywords related to filing dates, submission types, registrant details, and financial data.\\n- Default to the most recent time period (\\'2024q3\\') if not specified, and consider all asset classes unless otherwise mentioned.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDefault values and assumptions:\\n- Assume the most recent filing period (\\'2024q3\\') if no time period is specified, which is indicated by QUARTER column in the database.\\n- Include all asset classes and sectors unless specified in the query.\\n- Retrieve all filings if no specific criteria are provided.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nReasoning Instructions:\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Look at their borrowing trends.\\n    ```\\n    \\n```\\nTask Description:\\nThe task is to transform the natural language query into a SQL query for SQLite database.\\nThis involves parsing the intent of the query and understanding the structure of the data to generate an appropriate SQL command.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDatabase Overview:\\n- The Database combines information from 30 tables of the NPORT dataset from quarter 4 of 2019 to quarter 3 of 2024.\\n- The data includes a comprehensive view of fund-level information, holdings, debt securities, repurchase agreements, and derivative instruments.\\n- Each relation represents detailed information about financial transactions, security holdings, and fund performance, including key identifiers like ACCESSION_NUMBER, HOLDING_ID, and CUSIP for borrowers, holdings, and securities.\\n- The table provides essential metrics like total assets, liabilities, interest rate risks, monthly returns, and details for securities lending and collateral.\\n- The table aggregates all the data to provide a holistic view of financial activities for the 2019q4 to 2024q3 period.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNatural Language Processing Instructions:\\n- Decompose the user\\'s query to identify requirements regarding asset classes, sectors, time periods, or specific filings.\\n- Detect keywords related to filing dates, submission types, registrant details, and financial data.\\n- Default to the most recent time period (\\'2024q3\\') if not specified, and consider all asset classes unless otherwise mentioned.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDefault values and assumptions:\\n- Assume the most recent filing period (\\'2024q3\\') if no time period is specified, which is indicated by QUARTER column in the database.\\n- Include all asset classes and sectors unless specified in the query.\\n- Retrieve all filings if no specific criteria are provided.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nReasoning Instructions:\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Like growth vs value funds?\\n    ```\\n    \\n```\\nTask Description:\\nThe task is to transform the natural language query into a SQL query for SQLite database.\\nThis involves parsing the intent of the query and understanding the structure of the data to generate an appropriate SQL command.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDatabase Overview:\\n- The Database combines information from 30 tables of the NPORT dataset from quarter 4 of 2019 to quarter 3 of 2024.\\n- The data includes a comprehensive view of fund-level information, holdings, debt securities, repurchase agreements, and derivative instruments.\\n- Each relation represents detailed information about financial transactions, security holdings, and fund performance, including key identifiers like ACCESSION_NUMBER, HOLDING_ID, and CUSIP for borrowers, holdings, and securities.\\n- The table provides essential metrics like total assets, liabilities, interest rate risks, monthly returns, and details for securities lending and collateral.\\n- The table aggregates all the data to provide a holistic view of financial activities for the 2019q4 to 2024q3 period.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNatural Language Processing Instructions:\\n- Decompose the user\\'s query to identify requirements regarding asset classes, sectors, time periods, or specific filings.\\n- Detect keywords related to filing dates, submission types, registrant details, and financial data.\\n- Default to the most recent time period (\\'2024q3\\') if not specified, and consider all asset classes unless otherwise mentioned.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDefault values and assumptions:\\n- Assume the most recent filing period (\\'2024q3\\') if no time period is specified, which is indicated by QUARTER column in the database.\\n- Include all asset classes and sectors unless specified in the query.\\n- Retrieve all filings if no specific criteria are provided.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nReasoning Instructions:\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Need to check geographic concentration.\\n    ```\\n    \\n```\\nTask Description:\\nThe task is to transform the natural language query into a SQL query for SQLite database.\\nThis involves parsing the intent of the query and understanding the structure of the data to generate an appropriate SQL command.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDatabase Overview:\\n- The Database combines information from 30 tables of the NPORT dataset from quarter 4 of 2019 to quarter 3 of 2024.\\n- The data includes a comprehensive view of fund-level information, holdings, debt securities, repurchase agreements, and derivative instruments.\\n- Each relation represents detailed information about financial transactions, security holdings, and fund performance, including key identifiers like ACCESSION_NUMBER, HOLDING_ID, and CUSIP for borrowers, holdings, and securities.\\n- The table provides essential metrics like total assets, liabilities, interest rate risks, monthly returns, and details for securities lending and collateral.\\n- The table aggregates all the data to provide a holistic view of financial activities for the 2019q4 to 2024q3 period.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNatural Language Processing Instructions:\\n- Decompose the user\\'s query to identify requirements regarding asset classes, sectors, time periods, or specific filings.\\n- Detect keywords related to filing dates, submission types, registrant details, and financial data.\\n- Default to the most recent time period (\\'2024q3\\') if not specified, and consider all asset classes unless otherwise mentioned.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDefault values and assumptions:\\n- Assume the most recent filing period (\\'2024q3\\') if no time period is specified, which is indicated by QUARTER column in the database.\\n- Include all asset classes and sectors unless specified in the query.\\n- Retrieve all filings if no specific criteria are provided.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nReasoning Instructions:\\n1. Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double

It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4.

Reasoning you provide should first focus on why a nested query was chosen or why it wasn\\'t chosen.\\n2. It should give a query plan on how to solve this question - explain \\nthe mapping of the columns to the words in the input question.\\n3. It should explain each of the clauses and why they are structured the way they are structured. \\n   For example, if there is a `GROUP BY`, an explanation should be given as to why it exists.\\n4. If there\\'s any `SUM()` or any other function used, it should be explained as to why it was required.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nExample queries set 1, where Natural language request is encased in double
