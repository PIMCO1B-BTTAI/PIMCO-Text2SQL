submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

queries: predict NESTED\\n- elif need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries: predict NON-NESTED\\n- elif don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries: predict EASY\\n\\nConsider table

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\" needs these tables = [registrant], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Find the names and CIK of registrants in California, but only for those whose total assets are above 100 million.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\", fund_reported_info.total_assets > 100000000]\\nA: Let\\'s analyze this. The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query. So, the SQL query can be classified as \"NESTED.\"\\nLabel: \"NESTED\"\\n\\nQ: \"Find borrowers who have borrowed more than $5,000,000, including their names and LEIs.\"\\nrelevant_schema_links: {\\'table_columns\\': [\\'registrant.lei\\', \\'registrant.registrant_name\\', \\'borrower.borrower_id\\', \\'borrower.borrower_id\\'], \\'primary_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.BORROWER_ID\\'], \\'foreign_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\']}\\nA: Let\\'s think step by step.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets.

The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets.

The SQL query for the question \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\" needs these tables = [registrant], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Find the names and CIK of registrants in California, but only for those whose total assets are above 100 million.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\", fund_reported_info.total_assets > 100000000]\\nA: Let\\'s analyze this. The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query. So, the SQL query can be classified as \"NESTED.\"\\nLabel: \"NESTED\"\\n\\nQ: \"Identify issuers with more than three different securities holdings, including their names and CUSIPs.\"\\nrelevant_schema_links: {\\'table_columns\\': [\\'fund_reported_info.assets_attrbt_to_misc_security\\', \\'fund_reported_holding.issuer_name\\', \\'fund_reported_holding.issuer_cusip\\', \\'fund_reported_holding.holding_id\\', \\'registrant.registrant_name\\'], \\'primary_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\'], \\'foreign_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROW_AGGREGATE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_VAR_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'EXPLANATORY_NOTE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'IDENTIFIERS.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY_REF_INSTRUMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_AGREEMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COLLATERAL.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SWAPTION_OPTION_WARNT_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_BASKET.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_COMPONENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_OTHER.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FUT_FWD_NONFOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FWD_FOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FLOATING_RATE_RESET_TENOR.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV_NOTIONAL_AMOUNT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\']}\\nA: Let\\'s think step by step.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Tables Involved**: \n",
      "   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table is relevant because it contains information about securities holdings, including `ISSUER_NAME` and `ISSUER_CUSIP`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operations Required**:\n",
      "   - We need to count the number of different securities holdings for each issuer. This requires grouping by `ISSUER_NAME` and counting the distinct `HOLDING_ID` or another unique identifier for securities.\n",

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets.

The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query. So, the SQL query can be classified as \"NESTED.\"\\nLabel: \"NESTED\"\\n\\nQ: \"List funds with liquidation preferences exceeding their net assets.\"\\nrelevant_schema_links: {\\'table_columns\\': [\\'fund_reported_info.liquidation_preference\\', \\'fund_reported_info.liquidation_preference\\', \\'fund_reported_holding.asset_cat\\', \\'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund\\', \\'fund_reported_info.net_assets\\'], \\'primary_keys\\': [\\'FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID\\'], \\'foreign_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROW_AGGREGATE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_VAR_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'EXPLANATORY_NOTE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'IDENTIFIERS.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY_REF_INSTRUMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_AGREEMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COLLATERAL.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SWAPTION_OPTION_WARNT_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_BASKET.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_COMPONENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_OTHER.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FUT_FWD_NONFOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FWD_FOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FLOATING_RATE_RESET_TENOR.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV_NOTIONAL_AMOUNT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\']}\\nA: Let\\'s think step by step.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query. So, the SQL query can be classified as \"NESTED.\"\\nLabel: \"NESTED\"\\n\\nQ: \"Compare the latest net asset values of the top 5 performing funds.\"\\nrelevant_schema_links: {\\'table_columns\\': [\\'borrower.aggregate_value\\', \\'fund_reported_holding.asset_cat\\', \\'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund\\', \\'fund_reported_info.net_assets\\', \\'fund_reported_info.assets_attrbt_to_misc_security\\'], \\'primary_keys\\': [\\'FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.BORROWER_ID\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID\\'], \\'foreign_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROW_AGGREGATE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_VAR_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'EXPLANATORY_NOTE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'IDENTIFIERS.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY_REF_INSTRUMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_AGREEMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COLLATERAL.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SWAPTION_OPTION_WARNT_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_BASKET.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_COMPONENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_OTHER.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FUT_FWD_NONFOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FWD_FOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FLOATING_RATE_RESET_TENOR.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV_NOTIONAL_AMOUNT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\']}\\nA: Let\\'s think step by step.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",

The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\" needs these tables = [registrant], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Find the names and CIK of registrants in California, but only for those whose total assets are above 100 million.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\", fund_reported_info.total_assets > 100000000]\\nA: Let\\'s analyze this. The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query. So, the SQL query can be classified as \"NESTED.\"\\nLabel: \"NESTED\"\\n\\nQ: \"Calculate the overall average return across all funds for the most recent month.\"\\nrelevant_schema_links: {\\'table_columns\\': [\\'monthly_total_return.monthly_total_return_id\\', \\'monthly_total_return.monthly_total_return_id\\', \\'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund\\', \\'nonforeign_exchange_swap.upfront_receipt\\'], \\'primary_keys\\': [\\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN_ID\\', \\'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID\\'], \\'foreign_keys\\': [\\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\']}\\nA: Let\\'s think step by step.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets.

submission.sub_type = \"NPORT-P\", submission.accession_number]\\nA: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question \"Find the filing date and submission number of all reports filed for an NPORT-P submission.\" needs these tables = [submission], so we don\\'t need JOIN.\\nPlus, it doesn\\'t require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [\"\"]. \\nSo, we don\\'t need JOIN and don\\'t need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as \"EASY\".\\nLabel: \"EASY\"\\n\\nQ: \"Get the names and CIK of registrants who are located in California.\"\\nschema_links: [registrant.registrant_name, registrant.cik, registrant.state = \"US-CA\"]\\nA: Let’s think step by step.

The query involves data from two tables: \"registrant\" for registrant details and \"fund_reported_info\" for total assets. Since we need to check if total assets exceed 100 million, a nested query is necessary to filter based on this condition. This is a nested query. So, the SQL query can be classified as \"NESTED.\"\\nLabel: \"NESTED\"\\n\\nQ: \"Retrieve funds that have experienced a net decrease in assets over the last three reporting periods.\"\\nrelevant_schema_links: {\\'table_columns\\': [\\'submission.report_ending_period\\', \\'submission.report_ending_period\\', \\'fund_reported_holding.asset_cat\\', \\'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund\\', \\'fund_reported_info.net_assets\\'], \\'primary_keys\\': [\\'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID\\'], \\'foreign_keys\\': [\\'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROWER.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'BORROW_AGGREGATE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'MONTHLY_RETURN_CAT_INSTRUMENT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_VAR_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'EXPLANATORY_NOTE.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER\\', \\'IDENTIFIERS.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DEBT_SECURITY_REF_INSTRUMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'CONVERTIBLE_SECURITY_CURRENCY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_AGREEMENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'REPURCHASE_COLLATERAL.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DERIVATIVE_COUNTERPARTY.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SWAPTION_OPTION_WARNT_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_BASKET.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_INDEX_COMPONENT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'DESC_REF_OTHER.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FUT_FWD_NONFOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FWD_FOREIGNCUR_CONTRACT_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'NONFOREIGN_EXCHANGE_SWAP.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'FLOATING_RATE_RESET_TENOR.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'OTHER_DERIV_NOTIONAL_AMOUNT.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\', \\'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID\\']}\\nA: Let\\'s think step by step.'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}\n",
