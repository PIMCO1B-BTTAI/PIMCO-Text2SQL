classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find registrants with securities in multiple countries," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: We need information about registrants and the countries where their securities are held. This involves the `REGISTRANT` table for registrant details and the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table for information about the holdings, including the `INVESTMENT_COUNTRY`.

2. **Join Requirement**: We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the foreign key to link registrants with their holdings.

3. **Multiple Countries**: To find registrants with securities in multiple countries, we need to group the data by registrant and count the distinct countries. This requires aggregation and a `HAVING` clause to filter registrants with more than one distinct country.

Given these steps, the query requires a join between two tables and aggregation to count distinct countries. However, it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table provides information about the registrant's name and country, while the 'fund_reported_info' table contains details about securities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we need to find registrants with securities in multiple countries, we should join the 'registrant' and 'fund_reported_info' tables on the 'ACCESSION_NUMBER' to link registrants with their securities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to group the results by 'registrant_name' and count distinct countries. If the count is greater than one, it indicates that the registrant has securities in multiple countries.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We don't need additional filters, but we need to ensure that the grouping and counting logic is correctly applied to identify registrants with securities in multiple countries.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, ensure the SQL query is structured to select only the registrant names that meet the criteria of having securities in multiple countries.', helpful=True)]
