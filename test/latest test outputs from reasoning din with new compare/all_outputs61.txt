classification reasoning: The question "How many funds does each investment company manage?" requires us to determine the number of funds associated with each investment company. This involves counting the number of distinct funds (likely represented by series or similar identifiers) for each registrant or investment company.

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify the tables involved: We need information about funds and their association with investment companies. The relevant tables are likely "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" (for fund details) and "REGISTRANT" (for investment company details).

2. Determine the relationship: We need to join these tables based on a common key, such as "ACCESSION_NUMBER," to link funds to their respective investment companies.

3. Aggregate the data: We need to count the number of funds for each investment company, which requires grouping by the investment company identifier (e.g., CIK or REGISTRANT_NAME).

Since this requires joining tables and aggregating data, it involves a JOIN operation but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required for this query. The question is about funds and investment companies, so we should look for tables that contain information about funds and their associated companies.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The schema information provided does not explicitly mention a table for investment companies. However, the 'FUND_REPORTED_INFO' table seems relevant as it might contain information about funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to determine if there is a column that links funds to investment companies. This might be through a foreign key or a specific column in the 'FUND_REPORTED_INFO' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Since the schema does not provide explicit details about investment companies, we will assume that the 'ACCESSION_NUMBER' in 'FUND_REPORTED_INFO' can be used to group funds by their managing company.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We will use a simple SQL query with a GROUP BY clause to count the number of funds managed by each investment company, assuming 'ACCESSION_NUMBER' represents the company.", helpful=True)]
