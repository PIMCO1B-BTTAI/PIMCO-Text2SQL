{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "List all funds managed by registrants in California," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - We need information about registrants and their location, which is found in the `REGISTRANT` table.
   - We also need information about the funds they manage, which is found in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

2. **Determine Necessary Joins**:
   - We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to link registrants with the funds they manage. This can be done using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key.

3. **Filter by Location**:
   - We need to filter registrants based in California, which involves checking the `STATE` column in the `REGISTRANT` table for the value "CA".

4. **Select Required Information**:
   - We need to select the fund information from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

Given these steps, the query requires a join between the `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` tables, but it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table is crucial as it contains information about the registrants, and we need to filter those based in California.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to link registrants to the funds they manage. This involves understanding the foreign key relationships between 'registrant', 'fund_reported_info', and potentially 'securities_lending'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should use a JOIN operation to connect the 'registrant' table with the 'fund_reported_info' table using the 'accession_number' as the linking key.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The WHERE clause should filter registrants based in California. This requires a column that specifies the location of the registrant, which is not explicitly mentioned in the schema but is assumed to be part of the 'registrant' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we need to select the relevant columns, such as the fund names or identifiers, from the 'fund_reported_info' table to list the funds managed by these registrants.", helpful=True)]
