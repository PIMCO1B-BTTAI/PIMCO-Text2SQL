classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Find all funds where monthly sales flow for the second month is positive" involves checking the "sales_flow_mon2" column in the "fund_reported_info" table to see if it is greater than zero. This query only requires data from the "fund_reported_info" table and does not involve any joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query. The table 'fund_reported_info' seems to be the relevant one as it contains columns related to sales flow.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine the specific column that represents the sales flow for the second month. The schema information provided does not explicitly list a 'sales_flow_mon2', but it is logical to assume that the second month sales flow would be similarly named.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to construct a WHERE clause that filters for positive sales flow in the second month. This involves checking if the value in the 'sales_flow_mon2' column is greater than zero.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and does not require any aggregation or complex joins, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause will suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should ensure that the query is correctly formatted and syntactically valid to retrieve the desired results.', helpful=True)]
