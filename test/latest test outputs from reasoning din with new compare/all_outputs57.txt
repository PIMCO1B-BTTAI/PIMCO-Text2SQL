Schema Links for Question: Help me find funds that might be too concentrated in specific sectors
{'table_columns': ['securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine if a fund is too concentrated in specific sectors, we need to analyze the distribution of its holdings across different asset categories or sectors. This requires examining the holdings data, which is likely stored in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, specifically looking at the `ASSET_CAT` or `ISSUER_TYPE` columns to identify the sector or category of each holding.

To achieve this, we would need to:

1. Aggregate the holdings by sector or asset category.
2. Calculate the percentage of total holdings or net assets that each sector represents.
3. Identify funds where a single sector or a few sectors represent a disproportionately large percentage of the total holdings.

This process involves joining the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to access the total net assets for percentage calculations. Since this requires joining tables and potentially using subqueries to calculate percentages and identify concentration, the query would be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The schema information suggests that the 'securities_lending' table is involved, and it is linked to 'fund_reported_holding' through the 'holding_id'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are looking for funds concentrated in specific sectors, we need to aggregate holdings by sector and calculate the concentration for each fund.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the total value of holdings per sector for each fund. This will help in determining the concentration of each sector within a fund.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A second CTE can be used to calculate the total value of all holdings for each fund. This will allow us to compute the percentage of each sector within a fund.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we can use a WHERE clause to filter funds where a single sector exceeds a certain concentration threshold, indicating potential over-concentration.', helpful=True)]
