{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Identify funds managed by multiple registrants," we need to determine if a fund is associated with more than one registrant. This involves checking the relationships between funds and registrants.

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `REGISTRANT`: Contains information about registrants.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: Contains information about funds.

2. **Primary and Foreign Keys**:
   - `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER` is a primary key in the `REGISTRANT` table.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER` is a foreign key that links to `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

3. **Logic**:
   - We need to find funds (`FUND_REPORTED_INFO.SERIES_ID`) that are associated with more than one `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.
   - This requires grouping by `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.SERIES_ID` and counting distinct `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER`.

4. **Query Type**:
   - This requires a JOIN between `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to associate funds with registrants.
   - We need to use a GROUP BY clause and HAVING to filter funds managed by multiple registrants.

Since the query involves a JOIN and aggregation with GROUP BY and HAVING, it is classified as "NON-NESTED."

Since we need to find funds managed by multiple registrants, we should look for a way to group funds and count distinct registrants managing them.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a GROUP BY clause to group by fund identifiers and use a HAVING clause to filter those with more than one distinct registrant.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider the foreign key relationships.
