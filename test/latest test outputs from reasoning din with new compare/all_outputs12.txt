classification reasoning: The question "Which funds have zero liabilities?" requires us to identify funds with total liabilities equal to zero. This information is available in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, specifically in the "total_liabilities" column. Since we only need data from this single table and there is no requirement for nested queries or joins with other tables, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

classification: "EASY"
================================================================================
Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_liabilities' column, which is crucial for determining funds with zero liabilities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are only interested in funds with zero liabilities, we do not need to join with other tables or perform aggregations.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter the records where 'total_liabilities' is equal to zero.", helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT ACCESSION_NUMBER FROM fund_reported_info WHERE total_liabilities = 0;
================================================================================
final_output: SELECT SERIES_NAME FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO WHERE TOTAL_LIABILITIES = 0
================================================================================
True, all ground truth columns exist, and rows match
