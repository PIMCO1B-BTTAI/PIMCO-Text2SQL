classification reasoning: The question "Show me the largest bond funds" requires identifying bond funds and determining their size, likely based on total assets or net assets. To achieve this, we need to:

1. Identify bond funds, which might involve filtering based on asset categories or series names that indicate bond funds. This information could be in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, possibly under "SERIES_NAME" or "ASSET_CAT" in the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table.

2. Determine the size of these funds, which would involve looking at columns like "TOTAL_ASSETS" or "NET_ASSETS" in the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table.

3. Since the question asks for the largest, we would need to sort the results by size and possibly limit the number of results to show only the largest funds.

Given these steps, we would need to join tables to filter and sort the data appropriately. However, the question does not specify a need for nested queries, such as using subqueries to filter or aggregate data across multiple conditions or tables.

Therefore, the SQL query would require JOIN operations to combine data from relevant tables but does not require nested queries. Thus, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
