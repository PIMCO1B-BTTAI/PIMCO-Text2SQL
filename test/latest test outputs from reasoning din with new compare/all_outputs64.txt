classification reasoning: To determine which securities are most actively lent out, we need to analyze the data related to securities lending. This involves examining the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table, which contains information about securities lending activities. However, to identify specific securities, we would also need to reference the "FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING" table, which provides details about the holdings, including the securities being lent.

The query would likely involve joining these two tables to match securities lending activities with specific securities. Since this requires joining tables to gather the necessary information, the query would be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains information about securities being lent out. The table 'fund_reported_info' with the column 'assets_attrbt_to_misc_security' seems relevant.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any aggregation is needed. Since we are looking for the 'most actively lent out' securities, we should consider using an aggregation function like COUNT or SUM to quantify activity.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should consider if any joins are necessary. Based on the schema information, there are several foreign keys linking 'fund_reported_info' to other tables, but without specific details on lending activity, we will focus on the main table first.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause will be necessary to aggregate the data by security type or identifier, allowing us to count or sum the activity for each security.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should order the results to identify the most actively lent out securities, likely using an ORDER BY clause with a DESC modifier.', helpful=True)]
