================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "List all funds and their associated registrants, sorted by filing date," we need to consider the tables involved and the relationships between them.

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains information about the funds.
   - The `REGISTRANT` table contains information about the registrants.
   - The `SUBMISSION` table contains the filing date, which is needed for sorting.

2. **Joins Required**:
   - We need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `REGISTRANT` to get the registrant details for each fund. This can be done using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key.
   - We also need to join `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `SUBMISSION` to get the filing date for sorting.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The results need to be sorted by the `FILING_DATE` from the `SUBMISSION` table.

Since this query involves joining multiple tables to gather the required information and does not require any nested queries, it can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question involves funds and registrants, so we need to consider tables that contain information about funds and registrants.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins are needed. Since the schema information provides foreign key relationships between tables, we need to join the relevant tables to get the desired information.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to select the appropriate columns. The question asks for funds and their associated registrants, so we need to select columns that represent these entities.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider how to structure the ORDER BY clause. The question specifies sorting by filing date, so we need to ensure the query orders the results by the filing date column.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, ensure the query is non-nested as per the complexity level. We can achieve this by using JOINs instead of subqueries.', helpful=True)]
