================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show all funds with cash not reported exceeding total liabilities," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The question involves comparing values from the `fund_reported_info` table, specifically the `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` and `total_liabilities` columns.

2. **Condition**: We need to filter records where `cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` is greater than `total_liabilities`.

3. **No Joins Required**: Since both columns are from the same table (`fund_reported_info`), there is no need to join with other tables.

4. **No Nested Queries Required**: The query does not require any nested operations like subqueries or set operations (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT).

Given these points, the query can be executed directly on the `fund_reported_info` table without any joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for this query. The relevant table here is 'fund_reported_info' as it contains both 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' and 'total_liabilities'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine the condition for the WHERE clause. The condition is that 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' should be greater than 'total_liabilities'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and does not require any aggregation or complex joins, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause will suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We do not need any GROUP BY clause as we are not aggregating data, just filtering based on a condition.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, ensure that the SELECT statement retrieves all columns from 'fund_reported_info' that are relevant to the user query.", helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT * FROM fund_reported_info WHERE cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d > total_liabilities;
================================================================================
final_output: SELECT * FROM fund_reported_info WHERE cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d > total_liabilities
