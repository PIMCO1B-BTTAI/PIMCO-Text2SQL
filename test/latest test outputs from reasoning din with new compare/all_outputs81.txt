classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show funds whose liabilities are more than twice the average liability of all funds" involves calculating the average liability of all funds and then comparing each fund's liabilities to this average. This requires:

1. Calculating the average total liabilities from the `fund_reported_info` table.
2. Comparing each fund's total liabilities to twice this average.

This process involves using an aggregate function to calculate the average and then using this result in a comparison, which typically requires a nested query. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains the liability information. The 'fund_reported_info' table has a column 'total_liabilities' which is relevant.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to calculate the average liability of all funds. This requires an aggregation function, specifically AVG, on the 'total_liabilities' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to compare each fund's liabilities to twice the average liability. This suggests using a subquery to calculate the average and then using it in a WHERE clause.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='The query should be structured with a subquery to calculate the average liability, and the main query should filter funds based on the condition that their liabilities are more than twice this average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="No joins are necessary as all required data is within the 'fund_reported_info' table. The query will be straightforward with a subquery for the average calculation.", helpful=True)]
