classification reasoning: The question "Let's look at convertible securities with high conversion ratios - could be significant upside." involves analyzing convertible securities based on their conversion ratios. The relevant table for this query is "convertible_security_currency," which contains the "conversion_ratio" column. 

To identify convertible securities with high conversion ratios, we need to filter the data based on the "conversion_ratio" value. This operation can be performed using a simple query on the "convertible_security_currency" table without requiring any joins or nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query for this question can be classified as "EASY." 

Label: "EASY"

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The table 'convertible_security_currency' contains the 'conversion_ratio' which is the key metric we are interested in.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are only interested in the conversion ratios, no joins with other tables are necessary unless we need additional information about the securities.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should consider how to structure the WHERE clause to filter for 'high' conversion ratios. This requires defining what 'high' means, which could be a threshold value or a percentile.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Since the question does not specify a threshold for 'high', we can assume a simple query that retrieves all conversion ratios, allowing further analysis to determine what constitutes 'high'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, consider if a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause is needed. In this case, an ORDER BY clause on 'conversion_ratio' could be useful to sort the results by their conversion ratio in descending order.", helpful=True)]
