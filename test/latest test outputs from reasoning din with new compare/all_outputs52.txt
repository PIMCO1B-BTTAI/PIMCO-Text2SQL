classification reasoning: To determine which investment firms have the most diverse geographic exposure in their holdings, we need to analyze the data from the "fund_reported_holding" table, specifically the "investment_country" column. This requires counting the distinct countries for each firm, which involves grouping and counting operations. Additionally, we need to identify the investment firms, which would likely involve joining with the "registrant" table to get the firm names.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - "fund_reported_holding" for the "investment_country" data.
   - "registrant" to get the firm names associated with each holding.

2. **Operations Needed**:
   - Join between "fund_reported_holding" and "registrant" to associate holdings with firms.
   - Group by firm to count distinct "investment_country" entries for each firm.

3. **Classification**:
   - This requires a JOIN between "fund_reported_holding" and "registrant".
   - It does not require nested queries, as the task can be accomplished with grouping and aggregation.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves a JOIN but does not require nested queries.
