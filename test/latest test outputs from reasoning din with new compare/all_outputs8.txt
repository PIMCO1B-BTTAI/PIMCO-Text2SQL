Schema Links for Question: List all funds with 'Income' in their name
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Income' in their name" needs to identify funds based on their names. The relevant table for this information is "FUND_REPORTED_INFO," specifically the "SERIES_NAME" column, which contains the names of the funds. 

To find funds with 'Income' in their name, we can use a simple query with a WHERE clause to filter the "SERIES_NAME" column for entries containing the word 'Income'. This operation does not require any JOINs or nested queries, as it involves a straightforward filter on a single table.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. Since we are looking for funds, we should focus on tables that likely contain fund names.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Given the schema information, it seems we only need to focus on a table that contains fund names, so joins may not be necessary.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to extract the relevant column names for the SELECT and WHERE clauses. We are interested in fund names, so we should look for a column that likely contains this information.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The WHERE clause should filter fund names containing the word 'Income'. This can be done using a LIKE clause with a wildcard.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause to ensure it accurately filters the desired results without additional complexity.', helpful=True)]
