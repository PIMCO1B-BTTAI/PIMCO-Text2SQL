Schema Links for Question: List all funds with 'Index' in their name
{'table_columns': ['fund_var_info.designated_index_name', 'registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'FUND_VAR_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'FUND_VAR_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with 'Index' in their name" would involve searching for fund names that contain the word "Index." This can be done by querying the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table, specifically the "SERIES_NAME" column, to find entries that include "Index." Since this task only involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains the fund names. Based on the schema information, 'fund_var_info.designated_index_name' seems to be the relevant column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins are necessary. Since the question only asks for funds with 'Index' in their name, and no additional information from other tables is required, a join is not necessary.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should focus on constructing the WHERE clause to filter fund names containing the word 'Index'. This can be achieved using the LIKE operator.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and does not require aggregation or grouping, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause will suffice.', helpful=True)]

SQL: SELECT designated_index_name FROM fund_var_info WHERE designated_index_name LIKE '%Index%';
