{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID']}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all funds with 'Growth' in their name" needs to access the "fund_reported_info" table to find funds with 'Growth' in their name. Specifically, we would use the "SERIES_NAME" column to filter for names containing 'Growth'. This operation can be performed with a simple SELECT statement using a WHERE clause to filter the series names. 

Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOIN operations or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY".
