Schema Links for Question: List all registrants with their ZIP codes
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'interest_rate_risk.currency_code', 'registrant.zip'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.INTEREST_RATE_RISK_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'INTEREST_RATE_RISK.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all registrants with their ZIP codes" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically the columns "registrant_name" and "zip." Since all the required information is contained within a single table, we don't need to perform any JOIN operations. Additionally, the query does not require any nested queries, as it is a straightforward selection of columns from a single table. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question asks for registrants and their ZIP codes, which suggests the 'registrant' table is the primary source of data.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine the specific columns needed from the 'registrant' table. Based on the schema information, 'registrant.registrant_name' and 'registrant.zip' are the relevant columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the question does not specify any conditions or filters, a simple SELECT statement without a WHERE clause will suffice. There is no need for joins or nested queries as all required data is in a single table.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause is not necessary because the question does not ask for any aggregation or grouping of data.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The final SQL query should be straightforward, selecting the registrant name and ZIP code from the 'registrant' table.", helpful=True)]
