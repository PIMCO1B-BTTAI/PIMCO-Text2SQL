classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The question is about identifying funds that are equity-focused. This likely involves looking at the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, specifically the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which categorizes the asset type of the holding. We would look for entries where the asset category is "equity."

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since the question is about funds, we might need to join the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to access the asset category information. This requires a JOIN operation.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not seem to require nested queries, as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. We are simply filtering based on a condition.

Based on the above analysis, the query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains information about funds. The 'fund_reported_info' table seems to be the primary source for fund-related data.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to identify 'equity-focused' funds. This might be indicated by a specific value in the 'series_name' or 'assets_attrbt_to_misc_security' columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should check if there are any specific keywords or phrases in the 'series_name' that denote equity-focused funds. Common terms might include 'equity', 'stock', or similar.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and does not require aggregations or complex calculations, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause should suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We do not need to use any joins or nested queries as the required information is likely contained within a single table, 'fund_reported_info'.", helpful=True)]
