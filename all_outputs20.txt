classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me all equity-focused funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: The query is asking for equity-focused funds. This likely involves looking at the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, specifically the `ASSET_CAT` column, which categorizes the asset type of the holding. We would look for entries where `ASSET_CAT` is related to equities.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**: Since the query is focused on identifying funds based on their asset category, it primarily involves the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table. There is no indication that we need to join with other tables to get additional information.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**: The query does not require any complex operations like filtering based on aggregated data from multiple tables or using set operations (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT). It is a straightforward filter operation on a single table.

Based on this analysis, the query does not require JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The table 'fund_reported_info' seems relevant as it contains 'series_name', which likely includes the type of fund.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are only interested in equity-focused funds, we need to filter based on the 'series_name' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter the 'series_name' to include only those that are equity-focused. This likely involves a keyword like 'Equity' in the 'series_name'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='No complex joins or aggregations are needed as we are only filtering based on a specific column value.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The query should be straightforward, selecting from 'fund_reported_info' where 'series_name' contains 'Equity'.", helpful=True)]
