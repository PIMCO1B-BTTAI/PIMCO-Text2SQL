================================================================================
classification reasoning: To address the query "Find me funds that might be too exposed to interest rate changes - check their duration risk," we need to consider the following:

1. **Relevant Tables**: The query involves assessing interest rate risk, which is captured in the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table. This table contains columns like `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01`, `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01`, etc., which indicate the change in value of the portfolio resulting from a 1 basis point change in interest rates for different maturities.

2. **Data Extraction**: We need to extract data from the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table to evaluate the funds' exposure to interest rate changes. This involves looking at the DV01 (dollar value of a 1 basis point change) metrics for different maturities.

3. **Join Requirements**: Since the query is focused on interest rate risk, we primarily need data from the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table. However, to identify the specific funds, we might need to join with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key to get additional fund details if required.

4. **Query Complexity**: The query does not require nested queries, as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, or subqueries. We are simply extracting and possibly joining data between two tables.

Based on the above analysis, the query involves a straightforward join between `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to get the necessary details about funds and their interest rate risk exposure. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT fri.accession_number, fri.series_name
FROM interest_rate_risk irr
JOIN fund_reported_info fri ON irr.accession_number = fri.accession_number
WHERE irr.intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01 > 0.5
   OR irr.intrst_rate_change_1yr_dv01 > 0.5
   OR irr.intrst_rate_change_5yr_dv01 > 0.5
   OR irr.intrst_rate_change_10yr_dv01 > 0.5
   OR irr.intrst_rate_change_30yr_dv01 > 0.5;
```

In this query, `0.5` is used as a placeholder threshold for high sensitivity. You would replace it with an appropriate value based on your analysis or data distribution. The query joins the `interest_rate_risk` table with the `fund_reported_info` table to get the series name of the funds that are highly sensitive to interest rate changes.
