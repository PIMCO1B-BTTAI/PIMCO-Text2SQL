classification reasoning: To answer the question "What are the total assets of BlackRock funds?", we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The question involves finding the total assets of funds associated with BlackRock. 

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**
   - We need to find the total assets, which is available in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table under the column `total_assets`.
   - To identify BlackRock funds, we need to look at the `REGISTRANT` table, specifically the `registrant_name` column to filter for "BlackRock".

2. **Determine the Need for Joins:**
   - We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to filter the funds by the registrant name "BlackRock".
   - The join can be made using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key between `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.

3. **Determine the Complexity:**
   - Since we need to join two tables (`REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`) to get the desired information, this query requires a JOIN.
   - The query does not require nested queries as we are not using operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Based on the above analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it requires a JOIN but not nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_assets' column, which is directly relevant to the query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to determine how to filter the data to only include BlackRock funds. This likely involves a join with another table that contains fund names or identifiers.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The 'registrant' table might contain information about the fund names or identifiers, which can be used to filter for BlackRock funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include rows where the fund is associated with BlackRock.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we need to sum the 'total_assets' to get the total assets for all BlackRock funds.", helpful=True)]
