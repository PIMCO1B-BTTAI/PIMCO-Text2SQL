classification reasoning: The query "Could you check which states have the most fund registrants? Top 5 is fine." involves determining the number of registrants per state and then selecting the top 5 states with the most registrants. 

1. **Tables Involved**: The query primarily involves the "REGISTRANT" table, as it contains information about the registrants and their states.

2. **Operations Needed**:
   - **Aggregation**: We need to count the number of registrants per state.
   - **Sorting**: We need to sort the states by the number of registrants in descending order.
   - **Limiting**: We need to limit the results to the top 5 states.

3. **Joins**: There is no need to join with other tables since all required information is available in the "REGISTRANT" table.

4. **Nested Queries**: There is no need for nested queries as the operations can be performed using a single query with aggregation and sorting.

Based on the above analysis, the query does not require joins or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
