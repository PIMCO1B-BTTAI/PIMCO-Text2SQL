================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with their submission dates" involves retrieving data from two tables: "submission" for submission dates and "fund_reported_info" for fund details. To achieve this, we need to join these tables using the foreign key relationship between "submission.accession_number" and "fund_reported_info.accession_number." Since this requires a join but not a nested query, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

process_thesql: **
   - We will perform a `JOIN` operation between the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` tables using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as the joining key.
   - We will select the `SERIES_NAME` from the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table and the `FILING_DATE` from the `SUBMISSION` table.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT FRI.SERIES_NAME, S.FILING_DATE
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI
JOIN SUBMISSION S ON FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER = S.ACCESSION_NUMBER;
```

**Explanation:**
- `SELECT FRI.SERIES_NAME, S.FILING_DATE`: This selects the fund name and its corresponding submission date.
- `FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO FRI`: This specifies the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table as the source of fund names.
- `JOIN SUBMISSION S ON FRI.ACCESSION_NUMBER = S.ACCESSION_NUMBER`: This joins the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `SUBMISSION` table on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER`, ensuring that each fund is matched with its correct submission date.
