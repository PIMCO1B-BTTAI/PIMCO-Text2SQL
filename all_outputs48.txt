Schema Links for Question: List all funds with their submission dates
{'table_columns': ['submission', 'submission.filing_date', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all funds with their submission dates" involves retrieving data from two tables: "submission" for submission dates and "fund_reported_info" for fund details. To achieve this, we need to join these tables using the foreign key relationship between "submission.accession_number" and "fund_reported_info.accession_number." Since this requires a JOIN but not a nested query, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'submission' table contains the 'filing_date', which is likely the submission date we need.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins are necessary. The schema indicates a relationship between 'submission' and 'fund_reported_info' through 'accession_number'. However, the question only asks for funds and their submission dates, so we may not need to join with 'fund_reported_info'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should extract the relevant columns for the SELECT clause. These are 'submission.filing_date' for the submission date and potentially a column representing the fund, which is not explicitly mentioned in the schema.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the question does not specify any conditions or filters, a WHERE clause is not necessary. We will simply list all entries.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The query does not require any aggregation or grouping, as we are simply listing entries. Therefore, a GROUP BY clause is not needed.', helpful=True)]
