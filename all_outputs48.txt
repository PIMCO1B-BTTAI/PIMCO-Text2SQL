classification reasoning: To determine which investment styles are performing best this quarter, we need to analyze the performance data of different funds. This involves examining the returns or performance metrics of funds categorized by investment style, such as growth or value funds.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: We need to find tables that contain information about fund performance and investment styles. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table might contain information about the fund's assets, while the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table could provide performance data. However, the schema provided does not explicitly mention investment styles like growth or value.

2. **Join Tables**: To compare performance across different investment styles, we would likely need to join tables that contain performance data with those that categorize funds by style. This might involve joining `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` with `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` or other relevant tables.

3. **Aggregate and Compare**: Once the data is joined, we would aggregate performance metrics (e.g., total returns) by investment style and compare them to determine which style is performing best.

4. **Complexity**: Since this task involves joining multiple tables and possibly aggregating data to compare performance across categories, it requires a more complex query structure.

Given these steps, the query would likely involve multiple joins and aggregations, making it a "NON-NESTED" query. However, if the schema had explicit categories for investment styles, it might require additional logic to filter or categorize the data, potentially making it "NESTED." Based on the information provided, the task is best classified as "NON-NESTED" due to the need for joins and aggregations without explicit nested subqueries.

process_thesql: ```sql
SELECT 
    fri.series_name, 
    SUM(mtr.monthly_total_return1 + 
        mtr.monthly_total_return2 + 
        mtr.monthly_total_return3) AS quarterly_total_return
FROM 
    MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN mtr
JOIN 
    FUND_REPORTED_INFO fri ON mtr.accession_number = fri.accession_number
GROUP BY 
    fri.series_name
ORDER BY 
    quarterly_total_return DESC;
```

This query calculates the total return for each fund over the quarter by summing the monthly returns and orders the results to identify the best-performing funds. To classify funds into growth or value, additional data or assumptions would be needed.
