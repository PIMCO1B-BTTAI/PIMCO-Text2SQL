classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show registrants managing funds with liabilities higher than any convertible security fund," we need to compare the total liabilities of funds managed by registrants with the liabilities of funds that have convertible securities. This involves:

1. Retrieving the total liabilities from the `fund_reported_info` table.
2. Identifying funds with convertible securities using the `convertible_security_currency` table.
3. Comparing the total liabilities of registrants' funds to the liabilities of funds with convertible securities.

This requires a nested query because we need to:
- Use a subquery to find the maximum liabilities of funds with convertible securities.
- Compare each registrant's fund liabilities against this maximum value.

Since this involves a comparison that requires a subquery, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table is needed to get the registrant names, and the 'fund_reported_info' table is needed to get the total liabilities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to find the maximum liabilities of any convertible security fund. This involves using the 'convertible_security_currency' table to identify convertible securities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should use a subquery to find the maximum liabilities of any convertible security fund. This subquery will select the maximum 'total_liabilities' from 'fund_reported_info' where the fund is a convertible security.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The main query will then select registrant names from the 'registrant' table where the 'total_liabilities' in 'fund_reported_info' is greater than the result of the subquery.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we need to ensure that the subquery correctly identifies convertible security funds by joining 'convertible_security_currency' with 'fund_reported_holding' and then with 'fund_reported_info'.", helpful=True)]
