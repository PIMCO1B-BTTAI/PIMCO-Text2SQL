classification reasoning: The query requires comparing the total assets of individual funds to the average total assets of all funds. This involves calculating the average total assets, which is an aggregate operation, and then comparing each fund's total assets to this average. This requires a nested query: one to calculate the average and another to filter funds based on this average. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_assets' column, which is crucial for calculating both the total assets of individual funds and the average total assets across all funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any aggregations are needed. Since we need to compare each fund's total assets to the average total assets of all funds, we will calculate the average using an aggregate function.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a nested query to first calculate the average total assets of all funds. This will allow us to use this average value in the WHERE clause of the main query to filter funds whose total assets exceed this average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The main query will select funds from the 'fund_reported_info' table where the 'total_assets' is greater than the average calculated in the nested query. This requires a simple comparison in the WHERE clause.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="No joins are necessary for this query as all required data is contained within the 'fund_reported_info' table. The query will focus on aggregation and filtering based on the calculated average.", helpful=True)]
