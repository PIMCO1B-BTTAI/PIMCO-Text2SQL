classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show funds whose liabilities are more than twice the average liability of all funds" involves calculating the average liability of all funds and then comparing each fund's liabilities to this average. This requires a subquery to calculate the average liability, which will then be used in the main query to filter funds based on the condition. Since this involves a subquery, it is classified as a "NESTED" query.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table that contains the liability information, which is 'fund_reported_info'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to calculate the average liability of all funds. This requires an aggregation function, specifically AVG, on the 'total_liabilities' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to compare each fund's liabilities to twice the average liability. This requires a subquery to calculate the average and then a comparison in the WHERE clause.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='The query will use a nested structure where the subquery calculates the average liability, and the outer query filters funds based on the condition that their liabilities are more than twice this average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="No joins are necessary as all required data is within the 'fund_reported_info' table, simplifying the query structure.", helpful=True)]
