================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Identify funds managed by multiple registrants," we need to determine if a fund is associated with more than one registrant. This requires examining the relationships between funds and registrants.

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `REGISTRANT`: Contains information about registrants.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`: Contains information about funds.

2. **Relevant Columns**:
   - `REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER`: Unique identifier for each submission.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER`: Unique identifier for each submission.

3. **Join Requirement**:
   - We need to join `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` on `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link funds to registrants.

4. **Logic**:
   - We need to identify funds (possibly using `SERIES_ID` or `SERIES_NAME` from `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`) that are associated with more than one `ACCESSION_NUMBER` in the `REGISTRANT` table.

5. **Query Type**:
   - This requires a join between `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to associate funds with registrants.
   - We also need to group by the fund identifier and count distinct registrants to find those managed by multiple registrants.

Given these steps, the query involves a join and aggregation to count distinct registrants per fund. However, it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for the query. The 'registrant' and 'securities_lending' tables are mentioned in the schema, but we need to focus on the relationships between registrants and funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to determine how to identify funds managed by multiple registrants. This requires understanding the relationships between registrants and funds, likely through a join operation.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should consider using a GROUP BY clause to group funds and count the number of distinct registrants managing each fund. This will help us identify funds managed by more than one registrant.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A HAVING clause will be useful to filter out funds that are managed by only one registrant, allowing us to focus on those managed by multiple registrants.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we need to ensure that the query is structured correctly with the appropriate SELECT, FROM, JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses to achieve the desired result.', helpful=True)]
