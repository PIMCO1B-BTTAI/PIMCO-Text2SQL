classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "Show me the largest bond funds," we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to identify which table contains information about funds and their sizes. The `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table contains columns like `TOTAL_ASSETS`, which could be used to determine the size of a fund.
   - To identify bond funds specifically, we might need to look at the `ASSET_CAT` column in the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, which categorizes the asset type of the holding.

2. **Determine the Need for JOINs**:
   - To find the largest bond funds, we need to filter funds based on their asset category (bond) and then sort or filter by their total assets.
   - This requires joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table to access both the total assets and the asset category.

3. **Determine the Need for Nested Queries**:
   - The query does not inherently require nested queries like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN. It primarily involves filtering and sorting, which can be achieved with a straightforward JOIN and ORDER BY clause.

Based on the above analysis, the query requires a JOIN between tables but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. Since we are looking for bond funds, we need to identify which table contains information about funds and their categories.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to aggregate data to find the largest bond funds, which implies summing up some financial metric like total assets.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to filter the data to only include bond funds. This requires identifying a column that specifies the type of fund or asset category.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Consider how to structure the WHERE clause to filter for the latest data. This might involve using the 'submission.is_last_filing' column to ensure we are only considering the most recent filings.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we need to order the results to show the largest funds first. This will likely involve ordering by the aggregated financial metric in descending order.', helpful=True)]
