================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Which USD funds are most exposed to interest rate changes in 10 years?", we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:
   - We need information about funds and their exposure to interest rate changes. The `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table contains columns related to interest rate changes, specifically `INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_10YR_DV01` for 10-year exposure.
   - We also need to filter for funds denominated in USD, which can be identified using the `CURRENCY_CODE` column in the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table.

2. **Determine the Required Joins**:
   - We need to link the `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get details about the funds. This requires a join on the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` column, which is a foreign key relationship.

3. **Assess the Complexity**:
   - The query requires a join between `INTEREST_RATE_RISK` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` to get the necessary fund details and interest rate exposure.
   - There is no need for nested queries as we are not performing operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, or subqueries.

Based on the above analysis, the query involves a join but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'interest_rate_risk' table seems crucial as it contains information about interest rate changes.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine the specific column that indicates exposure to interest rate changes. The column 'intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01' might represent the sensitivity to interest rate changes.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should filter the results to only include USD funds. This might require checking if there's a column indicating the currency or joining with another table that provides this information.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since we are interested in the exposure over a 10-year period, we need to ensure that the data reflects this timeframe. If no specific column indicates this, we might assume the data is already aggregated over this period.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, we should order the results to show the most exposed funds first, likely by sorting in descending order of the 'intrst_rate_change_3mon_dv01' value.", helpful=True)]
