================================================================================
classification reasoning: To determine which funds are taking on the most interest rate risk, we need to analyze data related to interest rate risk and link it to specific funds. The relevant tables for this query are "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" and "FUND_REPORTED_INFO." We need to join these tables to associate interest rate risk data with specific funds.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" contains information about interest rate risk.
   - "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" contains information about the funds.

2. **Determine Relationships**:
   - The relationship between these tables is established through the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" field, which is a foreign key in "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" and a primary key in "FUND_REPORTED_INFO."

3. **Join Requirement**:
   - We need to join "INTEREST_RATE_RISK" with "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" using the "ACCESSION_NUMBER" to link interest rate risk data to specific funds.

4. **Analysis**:
   - We need to analyze the interest rate risk metrics (e.g., INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_3MON_DV01, INTRST_RATE_CHANGE_1YR_DV01, etc.) to determine which funds have the highest values, indicating the most risk.

Since this query requires joining two tables to associate interest rate risk data with specific funds, it is classified as "NON-NESTED." The query does not require nested queries but does require a join to combine data from multiple tables.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for determining interest rate risk.

This likely involves joining the 'interest_rate_risk' table with a table that contains fund information, such as 'fund_reported_info'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should consider using a GROUP BY clause to aggregate interest rate risk by fund, allowing us to identify which funds have the highest total risk.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='To find the funds taking on the most interest rate risk, we will need to order the results by the calculated risk metric in descending order.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we should ensure that the query is structured to return the fund identifiers and their associated risk levels, focusing on the highest risk values.', helpful=True)]
