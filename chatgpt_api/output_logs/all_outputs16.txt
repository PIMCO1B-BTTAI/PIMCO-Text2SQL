Schema Links for Question: Show me all registrants from Florida
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me all registrants from Florida" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically filtering by the state of Florida. This can be achieved by simply querying the "registrant" table with a condition on the "state" column. Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY".

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for the query. The table 'registrant' is likely the main table since it contains the 'registrant_name' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, we need to determine if there is a column that indicates the state of the registrant. However, the schema information provided does not explicitly mention a column for the state.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the schema does not provide a direct column for the state, we need to consider if there might be another table or a missing column in the schema that could provide this information.', helpful=False), Thought(thought="Given the lack of explicit state information in the schema, we will assume that the schema is incomplete and that there is a column in the 'registrant' table that can be used to filter by state.", helpful=False), Thought(thought="Finally, we will construct a simple SQL query assuming there is a 'state' column in the 'registrant' table to filter registrants from Florida.", helpful=True)]

SQL: SELECT registrant_name FROM registrant WHERE state = 'Florida';
