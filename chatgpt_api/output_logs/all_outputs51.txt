classification reasoning: To address the question "I need to check which funds may be too concentrated - find ones where a single holding is more than 10% of their portfolio," we need to identify holdings that constitute more than 10% of a fund's portfolio. This involves examining the percentage of each holding relative to the fund's net assets.

Here's the thought process:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - The `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table contains information about each holding, including the `percentage` column, which indicates the percentage of the holding relative to the fund's net assets.

2. **Filter Condition**:
   - We need to filter holdings where the `percentage` is greater than 10%.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - We need to identify the funds (or holdings) that meet this criterion. This involves selecting relevant columns such as `holding_id` or any other identifier that can help identify the fund.

4. **No Need for JOIN**:
   - Since all the necessary information is contained within the `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` table, there is no need to join with other tables.

5. **No Need for Nested Queries**:
   - The query does not require any nested operations like INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, or NOT IN.

Based on this analysis, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection and filtering operation on a single table without the need for joins or nested queries.
