classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the SQL query for the question "Find registrants with securities in multiple countries," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves identifying registrants with securities in multiple countries. This likely requires data from the `registrant` table for registrant details and the `fund_reported_holding` table for information about the securities and their associated countries.

2. **Joins**: We need to join the `registrant` table with the `fund_reported_holding` table using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key to link registrants to their reported holdings.

3. **Grouping and Filtering**: To find registrants with securities in multiple countries, we need to group the data by registrant and count the distinct countries associated with their securities. This requires aggregation and a `HAVING` clause to filter groups with more than one distinct country.

4. **Nested Queries**: The query does not necessarily require nested queries, as the task can be accomplished using joins and aggregation.

Based on these considerations, the SQL query would require a join between tables and aggregation to count distinct countries. Therefore, the query can be classified as "NON-NESTED" because it involves joins and aggregation but does not require nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' table contains information about registrants, including their names and countries. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains information about securities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to join 'registrant' and 'fund_reported_info' on the 'accession_number' to link registrants with their securities.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to identify registrants with securities in multiple countries. This requires grouping by registrant and counting distinct countries.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A HAVING clause is necessary to filter registrants with securities in more than one country. This ensures we only return those with multiple country associations.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider how to structure the SELECT clause to return the registrant names. We will select distinct registrant names that meet the criteria.', helpful=True)]
