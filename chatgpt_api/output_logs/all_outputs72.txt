classification reasoning: To answer the question "Show funds exposed to non-cash collateral," we need to identify funds that have non-cash collateral. The relevant column for this information is `fund_reported_info.is_non_cash_collateral`. 

The query involves only the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, as we are interested in funds with non-cash collateral exposure. We do not need to join with other tables or use nested queries, as the information is contained within a single table.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it does not require JOINs or nested queries.

classification: "EASY"
================================================================================
Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required for this query. The 'fund_reported_info' table is crucial because it contains the 'is_non_cash_collateral' column, which directly relates to the user's request.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins are necessary. The 'securities_lending' table might be relevant if we need to filter funds that are involved in lending activities, but the primary focus is on the 'is_non_cash_collateral' column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should focus on the 'is_non_cash_collateral' column to filter the funds. The query should include a WHERE clause that checks for non-cash collateral exposure.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the question does not specify a time period or require aggregation, a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause should suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The query should be straightforward without the need for CTEs or nested queries, as the requirement is to filter based on a single column condition.', helpful=True)]
