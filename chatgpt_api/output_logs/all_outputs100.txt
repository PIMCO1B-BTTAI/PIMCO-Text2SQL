classification reasoning: The query "Identify funds with above-average monthly redemption flows" involves calculating the average redemption flow and then identifying funds with redemption flows above this average. This requires:

1. Calculating the average redemption flow, which is an aggregate operation.
2. Comparing each fund's redemption flow against this calculated average.

These steps typically involve a subquery to calculate the average and then a comparison in the main query, which means a nested query is necessary. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."
