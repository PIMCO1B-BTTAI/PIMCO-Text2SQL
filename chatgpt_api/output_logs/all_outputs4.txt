Schema Links for Question: Show me the phone numbers of all Vanguard registrants
{'table_columns': ['submission.accession_number', 'registrant.registrant_name', 'registrant.phone'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show me the phone numbers of all Vanguard registrants" needs these tables = [registrant], so we don't need JOIN. We are looking for registrants with the name "Vanguard," which can be filtered directly from the "registrant" table. Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN). So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The relevant tables are 'submission' and 'registrant' since they contain the necessary columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since 'registrant' and 'submission' are linked through 'accession_number', a join is necessary to filter registrants by name.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to focus on the WHERE clause to filter registrants with the name 'Vanguard'. This will ensure we only get phone numbers for Vanguard registrants.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='No aggregations or groupings are needed as we are only interested in retrieving phone numbers, not performing calculations.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="Finally, ensure the SELECT clause retrieves only the 'phone' column from the 'registrant' table, as this is the information requested.", helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT registrant.phone FROM registrant JOIN submission ON registrant.accession_number = submission.accession_number WHERE registrant.registrant_name = 'Vanguard';
================================================================================
final_output: SELECT phone FROM registrant WHERE registrant_name = 'Vanguard'
