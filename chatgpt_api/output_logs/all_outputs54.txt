classification reasoning: To determine the classification of the query "I need to find funds with strong and consistent returns over all three months," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves analyzing the monthly returns of funds, which suggests the use of the `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN` table.

2. **Conditions**: The query requires checking the returns over three months, which means we need to evaluate the columns `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN1`, `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN2`, and `MONTHLY_TOTAL_RETURN3` for each fund.

3. **Complexity**: The query does not explicitly require data from multiple tables or any complex conditions that would necessitate a JOIN. However, it does require evaluating multiple columns for each fund to determine if the returns are "strong and consistent," which might involve some form of aggregation or comparison across the three months.

4. **Nested Queries**: The query does not inherently require nested queries, such as using subqueries to filter or aggregate data across different tables.

Based on these considerations, the query primarily involves evaluating conditions within a single table without the need for JOINs or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'monthly_total_return' table seems crucial as it likely contains return data for funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we are looking for consistent returns over three months, we need to aggregate data by fund and check for consistency.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the average return for each fund over the three months and then filter for those with strong and consistent returns.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The WHERE clause should filter funds based on a threshold for 'strong' returns, which needs to be defined. Consistency can be checked by ensuring returns do not vary significantly.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='A GROUP BY clause is necessary to aggregate the data by fund, allowing us to calculate average returns and check consistency across the three months.', helpful=True)]
