================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Which funds have assets between 100M and 500M?", we need to identify the relevant tables and columns. The table "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" contains information about the funds, including their total assets. We need to filter the funds based on the "TOTAL_ASSETS" column to find those with assets between 100 million and 500 million.

- The query involves only the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table.
- We do not need to join with any other tables since all the required information is in this table.
- The query does not require nested queries, as we are simply filtering based on a single condition.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY" because it involves a straightforward selection and filtering operation without the need for joins or nested queries.

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question is about funds and their assets, so we should focus on tables that contain information about funds and their reported assets.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since the question is about a specific range of asset values, we need to ensure that the table we use has a column that directly represents the asset value of the funds.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter the funds based on their asset values being between 100M and 500M. This requires a simple WHERE clause with a BETWEEN condition.', helpful=True)]
