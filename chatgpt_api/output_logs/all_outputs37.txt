================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "Show all funds with cash not reported exceeding total liabilities" involves comparing two columns from the same table: `fund_reported_info.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` and `fund_reported_info.total_liabilities`. Since both columns are from the `fund_reported_info` table, there is no need for a JOIN operation. Additionally, the query does not require any nested queries, as it involves a straightforward comparison within a single table. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main table required for this query. The table 'fund_reported_info' contains both 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' and 'total_liabilities', which are the key columns needed.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine the condition for the WHERE clause. The query requires us to find funds where 'cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d' is greater than 'total_liabilities'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the query is straightforward and involves a simple comparison between two columns in the same table, there is no need for JOINs or nested queries.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should ensure that the SELECT clause retrieves all relevant columns that identify the funds. However, the question does not specify which columns to display, so we will select all columns from the 'fund_reported_info' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we will structure the SQL query to include the SELECT and WHERE clauses based on the identified conditions and columns.', helpful=True)]
================================================================================
SQL: SELECT * FROM fund_reported_info WHERE cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d > total_liabilities;
================================================================================
final_output: SELECT SERIES_NAME 
FROM FUND_REPORTED_INFO 
WHERE CAST(CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D AS FLOAT) > CAST(TOTAL_LIABILITIES AS FLOAT)
