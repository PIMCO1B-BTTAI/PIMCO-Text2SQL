classification reasoning: The query "List registrants with above-average total assets in their state" involves comparing each registrant's total assets to the average total assets within their state. This requires calculating the average total assets per state and then comparing each registrant's total assets to this average. 

To achieve this, we need to:

1. Calculate the average total assets for each state. This involves grouping the data by state and using an aggregate function to compute the average.
2. Compare each registrant's total assets to the calculated average for their state.

This process involves using a subquery to calculate the average total assets per state, which is then used in the main query to filter registrants. Therefore, the query requires a nested query.

So, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'registrant' and 'fund_reported_info' tables are essential because they contain the 'state', 'registrant_name', and 'total_assets' columns.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to calculate the average total assets per state, which requires aggregation.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the average total assets for each state. This will simplify the main query by allowing us to compare each registrant's total assets to the average in their state.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='The main query will select registrants whose total assets exceed the average for their state, using the CTE for comparison.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A nested query structure is appropriate here because we need to perform a subquery to calculate the average total assets per state before filtering the main results.', helpful=True)]
