classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find existing funds with the highest proportion of liabilities to net assets," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The relevant table for this query is `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`, as it contains both `total_liabilities` and `net_assets`.

2. **Calculation**: We need to calculate the proportion of liabilities to net assets for each fund. This involves a simple arithmetic operation: `total_liabilities / net_assets`.

3. **Condition**: We are interested in "existing funds," which implies that we need to filter out funds that are not existing. This can be determined using the `IS_LAST_FILING` field in the `SUBMISSION` table, where 'N' indicates the fund is still active.

4. **Sorting and Limiting**: To find the fund with the highest proportion, we need to sort the results in descending order based on the calculated proportion and then select the top result.

5. **Join Requirement**: Since we need to filter based on the `IS_LAST_FILING` field from the `SUBMISSION` table, a join between `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `SUBMISSION` is necessary.

Given these steps, the query requires a join between two tables and involves sorting and filtering operations. However, it does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."
