classification reasoning: The query involves searching for funds with specific keywords ('sustainable' or 'ESG') in their names and retrieving their total assets under management (AUM). This requires data from the "fund_reported_info" table, specifically the "series_name" and "total_assets" columns. Since the query involves filtering based on a condition applied to a single table, it does not require any JOIN operations or nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'total_assets' column, which is relevant for calculating the total AUM.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to filter funds by name. Since the schema information does not explicitly mention a column for fund names, we assume that the 'fund_reported_info' table might contain such a column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We should use a WHERE clause to filter fund names containing 'sustainable' or 'ESG'. This will help us identify the relevant funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="To calculate the total AUM, we need to use the SUM function on the 'total_assets' column after filtering the relevant funds.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, since we are aggregating data, a GROUP BY clause is not necessary as we are only interested in the total sum.', helpful=True)]

SQL: SELECT SUM(fund_reported_info.total_assets) AS total_aum FROM fund_reported_info WHERE fund_reported_info.fund_name LIKE '%sustainable%' OR fund_reported_info.fund_name LIKE '%ESG%';
