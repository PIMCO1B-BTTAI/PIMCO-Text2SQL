Schema Links for Question: List all funds with their submission dates
{'table_columns': ['submission.filing_date', 'securities_lending.is_loan_by_fund', 'submission'], 'primary_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'foreign_keys': ['SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER', 'SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The question "List all funds with their submission dates" requires us to retrieve information about funds and their corresponding submission dates. To achieve this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: The question involves the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table to get information about the funds and the `SUBMISSION` table to get the submission dates.

2. **Join Requirement**: We need to join these two tables using the foreign key relationship `SUBMISSION.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER` to link each fund with its submission date.

3. **Nested Queries**: The query does not require any nested queries, as we are simply retrieving and joining data from two tables.

Based on the above analysis, the query requires a join but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The question asks for funds and their submission dates, so we need to focus on the 'submission' table which contains 'filing_date'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since the question does not specify any conditions or aggregations, a simple selection from the 'submission' table should suffice.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to ensure that the columns selected are relevant to the question. The 'submission' table should have a column that identifies the fund, which is likely the primary key or a related identifier.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider the structure of the SQL query. Since no complex conditions or aggregations are needed, a straightforward SELECT statement will be used.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, verify that the query aligns with the schema information provided, ensuring that the correct columns are selected and no unnecessary tables are included.', helpful=True)]
