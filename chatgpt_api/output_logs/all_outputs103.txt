================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find the total cash held by registrants whose largest fund exceeds $500 million," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - We need information about the registrants and their funds. The relevant tables are `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO`.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` contains the `TOTAL_ASSETS` for each fund, which we need to compare against the $500 million threshold.
   - `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` also contains `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D`, which represents the cash holdings we are interested in.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We need to filter funds where `TOTAL_ASSETS` exceed $500 million.
   - We need to sum the `CASH_NOT_RPTD_IN_C_OR_D` for registrants whose largest fund exceeds this threshold.

3. **Joins and Aggregations**:
   - We need to join `REGISTRANT` and `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` on `ACCESSION_NUMBER` to associate funds with their registrants.
   - We need to group by registrant to find the largest fund for each registrant.
   - We need to sum the cash holdings for registrants meeting the condition.

4. **Nested Query**:
   - A nested query is required to first determine the largest fund for each registrant and then filter those registrants whose largest fund exceeds $500 million.

Given these requirements, the query involves multiple tables and requires a nested query to filter based on the largest fund condition. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

We need a subquery to filter registrants whose largest fund exceeds $500 million, and then use this result to calculate the total cash.', helpful=True)]
