Schema Links for Question: List all registrants with their country
{'table_columns': ['registrant.registrant_name', 'registrant.country'], 'primary_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'foreign_keys': ['REGISTRANT.ACCESSION_NUMBER = FUND_REPORTED_INFO.ACCESSION_NUMBER'], 'schema_links': '[]'}
================================================================================
classification reasoning: The SQL query for the question "List all registrants with their country" needs data from the "registrant" table, specifically the columns "registrant_name" and "country." Since this query only involves a single table and does not require any JOINs or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY." 

Label: "EASY"

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="The question asks for a list of registrants along with their country, which suggests we need to select data from the 'registrant' table.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="The schema information indicates that the 'registrant' table contains the columns 'registrant_name' and 'country', which are exactly the columns we need to retrieve.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='There is no need for any joins or subqueries because all the required information is contained within a single table.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Since the task is straightforward and does not involve any filtering, aggregation, or complex conditions, a simple SELECT statement will suffice.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='The query does not require a WHERE clause or GROUP BY clause as we are retrieving all records without any conditions.', helpful=True)]
