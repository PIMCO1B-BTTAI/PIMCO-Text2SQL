classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find the largest fund in each state," we need to consider the following:

1. **Tables Involved**: We need information about the fund size and the state in which the registrant is located. This involves the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table for fund size (using `TOTAL_ASSETS`) and the `REGISTRANT` table for the state information.

2. **Join Requirement**: We need to join the `REGISTRANT` table with the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table. The join can be done using the `ACCESSION_NUMBER` as a foreign key.

3. **Grouping and Aggregation**: We need to group the results by state and find the largest fund in each state. This requires using an aggregation function like `MAX` on `TOTAL_ASSETS`.

4. **Nested Query**: To find the largest fund in each state, we need to use a nested query or a subquery. This is because we need to first determine the maximum fund size per state and then retrieve the corresponding fund details.

Given these steps, the query involves both a join and a nested query to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."
