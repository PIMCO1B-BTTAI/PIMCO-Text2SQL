================================================================================
classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find all funds where monthly sales flow for the second month is positive," we need to consider the relevant tables and columns. The relevant column for monthly sales flow for the second month is `fund_reported_info.sales_flow_mon2`. We need to filter funds where this value is positive.

1. **Tables Involved**: The query involves the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table, as it contains the `sales_flow_mon2` column.

2. **Conditions**: We need to filter the records where `sales_flow_mon2` is greater than zero.

3. **Joins**: There is no need to join with other tables since all the required information is in the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` table.

4. **Nested Queries**: There is no requirement for nested queries as we are only filtering based on a single condition within one table.

Since the query involves a simple filter on a single table without the need for joins or nested queries, it can be classified as "EASY."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought='First, we need to identify the main table that contains the sales flow data for the second month.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="The schema information provided does not explicitly list a column for the second month's sales flow, so we need to infer or assume its existence based on the pattern of the first month's column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Assuming a column named 'sales_flow_mon2' exists in the 'fund_reported_info' table, we can directly filter for positive values in this column.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="No complex joins or aggregations are needed since we are only interested in filtering based on a single column's value.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='The WHERE clause will be used to filter funds with positive sales flow for the second month.', helpful=True)]
