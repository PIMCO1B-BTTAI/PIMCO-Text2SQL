classification reasoning: The query "Show funds with a percentage of their portfolio in cash exceeding 20%" involves checking the percentage of the portfolio in cash. Based on the schema, the relevant column for cash percentage is `fund_reported_holding.percentage`. However, to determine the percentage of the portfolio in cash, we need to consider the `fund_reported_info.cash_not_rptd_in_c_or_d` column, which represents cash holdings not reported in specific asset parts.

To achieve this, we need to calculate the percentage of cash in the portfolio, which may require joining the `FUND_REPORTED_INFO` and `FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING` tables to access the necessary data. This involves a join operation but does not require nested queries.

Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_holding' table contains the 'percentage' column, which likely represents the percentage of the portfolio in different asset types, including cash.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine if any joins are necessary. Since the question is about funds and their cash holdings, we should check if there's a need to join with the 'fund_reported_info' table to get additional fund details, but it seems unnecessary for this specific query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="We need to focus on the 'percentage' column in the 'fund_reported_holding' table and apply a filter to find records where this percentage exceeds 20%.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider if a GROUP BY clause is needed. Since we are only interested in funds where the cash percentage exceeds a threshold, and not aggregating data, a GROUP BY is not required.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, structure the WHERE clause to filter funds with a cash percentage greater than 20%. Ensure the query is straightforward and non-nested as per the complexity level.', helpful=True)]
