classification reasoning: To determine which fund families are most active in securities lending, we need to analyze data from the "SECURITIES_LENDING" table to identify funds involved in lending activities. Additionally, we need to link this information to the "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" table to identify the fund families. This requires joining these tables based on the relevant foreign key relationship.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: 
   - "SECURITIES_LENDING" to check if the fund is involved in lending.
   - "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" to get information about the fund family.

2. **Join Requirement**: 
   - We need to join "SECURITIES_LENDING" with "FUND_REPORTED_INFO" using the foreign key relationship: `SECURITIES_LENDING.HOLDING_ID = FUND_REPORTED_HOLDING.HOLDING_ID`.

3. **Determine Activity**: 
   - We can count the number of lending activities per fund family to determine which are most active.

Since this involves joining two tables to gather the necessary information, the query requires a JOIN but does not require nested queries. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'securities_lending' table is crucial as it contains the 'is_loan_by_fund' column, which indicates activity in securities lending.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, we need to determine how to measure 'most active'. This likely involves counting or summing the number of loans made by each fund family.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We should consider using a GROUP BY clause to aggregate data by fund family, allowing us to count the number of loans each has made.', helpful=True), Thought(thought="A JOIN might be necessary to link the 'securities_lending' table with a table that contains fund family information, but the schema does not provide explicit fund family details. We will assume 'FUND_REPORTED_INFO' might contain relevant identifiers.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, we will order the results to identify the most active fund families, likely using an ORDER BY clause on the count of loans.', helpful=True)]
