classification reasoning: To answer the question "Find funds whose redemption flows exceed the highest redemption flow for any bond fund," we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Identify the Relevant Tables and Columns**: 
   - We need to look at the `fund_reported_info` table for redemption flows, specifically the `redemption_flow_mon1` column.
   - We also need to identify which funds are bond funds. This might require additional information from the `fund_reported_holding` table or another table that categorizes funds by asset type.

2. **Determine the Highest Redemption Flow for Bond Funds**:
   - We need to filter the funds to only include bond funds and then find the maximum redemption flow among these.

3. **Compare Other Funds' Redemption Flows**:
   - We need to compare the redemption flows of all funds against the maximum redemption flow identified for bond funds.

4. **Use of Nested Queries**:
   - A nested query is required to first determine the maximum redemption flow for bond funds. This result will then be used in the outer query to filter funds whose redemption flows exceed this maximum.

Given these steps, the query involves a nested query to find the maximum redemption flow for bond funds and then compares it with other funds. Therefore, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains the 'redemption_flow_mon1' column, which is crucial for this query.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. Since we need to compare redemption flows across different funds, an aggregation to find the maximum redemption flow for bond funds is necessary.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to use a subquery to find the highest redemption flow for bond funds. This subquery will be used in the WHERE clause of the main query to filter funds with higher redemption flows.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Consider how to structure the WHERE clause. The main query should select funds where the redemption flow is greater than the maximum redemption flow found in the subquery.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, ensure the query is structured correctly with proper indentation and logical flow, using a nested query to achieve the desired result.', helpful=True)]
