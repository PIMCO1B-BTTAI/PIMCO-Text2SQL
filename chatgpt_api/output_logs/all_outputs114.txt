classification reasoning: The query requires comparing the total liabilities of each fund with the average liabilities of all funds within the same state. This involves:

1. Calculating the average liabilities for each state, which requires aggregation.
2. Comparing each fund's liabilities to the calculated average for its state.

To achieve this, we need to perform a subquery to calculate the average liabilities per state and then compare each fund's liabilities against this average. This process involves using a nested query to first compute the average liabilities for each state and then filtering the funds based on this computed average.

Therefore, the SQL query requires nested queries to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons. Hence, the query can be classified as "NESTED."

Thoughts: [Thought(thought="First, we need to identify the main tables required. The 'fund_reported_info' table contains 'total_liabilities', and the 'registrant' table contains 'state'. These are crucial for calculating liabilities and grouping by state.", helpful=True), Thought(thought="Next, determine if any joins or aggregations are needed. We need to join 'fund_reported_info' and 'registrant' on a common key to access both 'total_liabilities' and 'state'.", helpful=True), Thought(thought='We need to calculate the average liabilities for each state. This requires a subquery or CTE to group by state and calculate the average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='Finally, consider how to structure the WHERE clause. We need to filter funds where their liabilities are less than the calculated state average.', helpful=True), Thought(thought='A nested query is appropriate here to first calculate the average liabilities per state and then filter the main query based on this result.', helpful=True)]
